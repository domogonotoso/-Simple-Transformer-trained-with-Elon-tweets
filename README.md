Use pretrained GPT2 Tokenizer, which is Byte-Pair-Encoding. Not use word unit text encoder, instead, we use it at a binary scale.

GELU


* Models like **GPT-2, GPT-3, BERT, RoBERTa, and T5**—essentially **almost all Transformer-based architectures**—use **GELU** activations.

* The reasons are:

  * When dealing with **subtle semantic differences** in natural language, **GELU provides smoother and more continuous gradients** than ReLU, which helps with training stability.
  * Especially during the **early stages of training**, ReLU can suffer from the **"dead neuron" problem**, whereas GELU avoids that with its softer activation curve.

Not word text token, BPE(Byte pair encoding). Because this we can see something that literally not like real words.
So, let's put text what model learned from processed.txt and give it longer one.

It seemed better and write exactly what they learned. But it is not enough. It doesn't to stop talking and not know where to stop. 
So I decided to do two ways. First, improve dataset to add punct at eos(end of sentence). Second, do knowledge distillation
