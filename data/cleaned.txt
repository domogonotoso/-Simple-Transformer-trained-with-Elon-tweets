i find the gold toe sock inevitably off kilter washed out a little troubling esthetically arguably a bit corpo <|endoftext|>
sock con the conference for socks <|endoftext|>
always something new for the magazine cover and the articles practically write themselves <|endoftext|>
sock tech is so advanced that you can get pretty much anything in sock form these days <|endoftext|>
i must confess to a penchant for creative socks <|endoftext|>
his success was in fact due in part because he was super fun at parties spoke and wrote incredibly well <|endoftext|>
while bleak posts maybe generate more clicks more happier moments in history would be nice <|endoftext|>
moon brought us together in mars can do that in the future <|endoftext|>
without a common goal humanity will fight itself <|endoftext|>
can you say more about this pressures that the government may have placed on twitter <|endoftext|>
humanity will reach mars in your lifetime <|endoftext|>
zip around vegas super fast with teslas in tunnels <|endoftext|>
structural pack is the right overall architecture from a physics standpoint but it is still far from optimized <|endoftext|>
also being ruggedized for relentless salt spray extreme winds storms in deep ocean is not easy <|endoftext|>
no its dual high performance terminals which are important for maintaining the connection in cho <|endoftext|>
a flying electric boat would be sickkk <|endoftext|>
not bad it is high time that the future looked like the future same goes for fashion <|endoftext|>
pretty much a van would have more roof height so you could stand or sit under it for shade <|endoftext|>
maybe with an optional solar power canopy that extends both sides of the van tripling roof area <|endoftext|>
maybe tesla should make a highly configurable robovan for people cargo <|endoftext|>
far too many people are under the illusion that earth is overpopulated even though birth rate trends are <|endoftext|>
i hope you have big families and congrats to those who already do <|endoftext|>
population of mars is still zero people <|endoftext|>
mark my words they are sadly true <|endoftext|>
doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis a collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far <|endoftext|>
wait a minute doc are you telling me you built a time machineout of a delorean back to the future <|endoftext|>
highly recommend revolutions by mike duncan especially season <|endoftext|>
the world is actually vastly better than orwell imagined but there is also vastly more surveillance <|endoftext|>
that is indeed the real question <|endoftext|>
i had same great experience from tokyo to osaka <|endoftext|>
china japan have awesome trains took bullet train from beijing to xian to see terracotta army of <|endoftext|>
super fired up for future product development with our awesome tesla team such an honor to work with them <|endoftext|>
kids are worth it if at all possible im planning to increase childcare benefits at my compan <|endoftext|>
agreed this needs to be addressed <|endoftext|>
the world has gone mad <|endoftext|>
future wars are all about the drones human crews of planes or tanks have no chance one exception <|endoftext|>
whoever controls the teleprompter is the real president <|endoftext|>
we know so little today i want to know the meaning of life or whatever the right quest <|endoftext|>
but sponges starfish obv can <|endoftext|>
consciousness can understand the nature of the universe clams not so much <|endoftext|>
interesting who is behind the bot attack <|endoftext|>
for improved quality of sleep raise head of your bed by about or cm and dont eat hours before bedtime <|endoftext|>
these polar launches will enable complete coverage of earth where approved by local government <|endoftext|>
but fifth element was great <|endoftext|>
base of the vehicle seems ok by flashlight i was just out t <|endoftext|>
cool congrats now the simulators will have to spend more money on rendering <|endoftext|>
rereading the life of greece by durant in recent months read american ca <|endoftext|>
i do recommend a lot of books <|endoftext|>
and too many little red or green led indicators <|endoftext|>
youtube keeps playing me the same annoying scam ads every time i use it the algorithm is convince <|endoftext|>
that is one of the things we will be doing going forward this particular i <|endoftext|>
trump would be at end of term which is too old to be chief executive of anything <|endoftext|>
yeah but too much drama do we really want a bull in a china shop situation every sing <|endoftext|>
i dont hate the man but its time for trump to hang up his hat sail into the sunset dems shoul <|endoftext|>
teslas automatic cabin overheat protection should make a real difference with record heatwaves ability to adjust <|endoftext|>
cryogenic fuel is an added challenge as it evaporates to create fuelair explosion ri <|endoftext|>
yeah actually not good team is assessing damage <|endoftext|>
mimic dark moon stars of ruin <|endoftext|>
good chance youre experiencing at least mild acid reflux at night affecting quality sleep without consciousness awareness <|endoftext|>
was just up in the booster propulsion section damage appears to be minor but we need to inspect all the engines <|endoftext|>
no problem to recycle the pack just think of any battery pack as super high grade ore i <|endoftext|>
most importantly we need to delete or thermally protect rem <|endoftext|>
goes to internal beta tomorrow external next week should handle chucks complex left turn bet <|endoftext|>
thanks for everything you have done for tesla it has been an honor working with you <|endoftext|>
absolutely and lithium batteries are the new oil <|endoftext|>
if testing goes well as soon as next month <|endoftext|>
gives whole new meaning to go pros <|endoftext|>
imagine if msnbc did that <|endoftext|>
mars is admittedly a fixer upper of a planet <|endoftext|>
the scale is anyone can visit <|endoftext|>
i wonder if there is a species in the magellanic clouds wondering who lives in the big galaxy they orbit <|endoftext|>
some small tubes wiring need to be nested in a b <|endoftext|>
electric power for booster ship is needed even when <|endoftext|>
enabling engines to take the heat without shrouds might save <|endoftext|>
all mass necessitated by an engine design should count as en <|endoftext|>
cumulative tonnage to orbit this year is the right metric <|endoftext|>
write to the that would be great <|endoftext|>
charlie ergen is trying steal the ghz band meant for space internet not cool <|endoftext|>
were making progress with steam integration demo probably next month <|endoftext|>
actually true then i suggested to the team that it didnt need to be quite so pointy since thats just b <|endoftext|>
if inflation calms down we can lower prices for cars <|endoftext|>
tesla is to protect life on earth spacex to extend life beyond <|endoftext|>
to years from first human landing if launch rate growth is exponential assumes transferring k <|endoftext|>
mars may be a fixer upper of a planet but it has great potential <|endoftext|>
also worth getting a particle counter <|endoftext|>
its on the future product list especially important in places like austin which has next <|endoftext|>
things will get wild when andromeda collides with our galaxy <|endoftext|>
true i have a co monitor on my desk it beeps whenever ppm <|endoftext|>
about twice as much useful mass to orbit as rest of earth combined <|endoftext|>
more accurate word is propellant rather than fuel starship is liquid oxygen <|endoftext|>
i use this example a lot <|endoftext|>
starlink bandwidth varies a lot depending on user terminal density time of day thats why th <|endoftext|>
starlink is a gamechanger for remote locations <|endoftext|>
one of the best features of model x <|endoftext|>
teslas are the most madeinusa vehicles <|endoftext|>
my calves are bigger tho <|endoftext|>
to think that fremont was just a derelict building giga nevada was just rocks bushes when started california <|endoftext|>
congrats to tesla fremont giga nevada for making their millionth car <|endoftext|>
please vote your shares with tesla <|endoftext|>
its a start about times more mass to orbit per year will be needed to make life multiplanetary <|endoftext|>
haha damn maybe i should take off my shirt more often free the nip already back in the factory btw <|endoftext|>
still needs a few tweaks <|endoftext|>
i remember the s which means im definitely not spring chicken <|endoftext|>
arguably we know more than nothing death taxes are a certainty bf <|endoftext|>
earth is basically empty of humans <|endoftext|>
tbh its good motivation to work out eat healthier maybe take my shirt off outside more than once a year haha <|endoftext|>
is this the real life is this just fantasy caught in a landside no escape from reality <|endoftext|>
interesting smart move by china expendable rockets have no future <|endoftext|>
congrats on an incredible company with airbnb now for book <|endoftext|>
service turns on next month which is same time required to deliver a user terminal so order now at <|endoftext|>
excited to work with tesla service to enable samehour service as often as possible applying formula pit crew techniques to teslas <|endoftext|>
major volcanic eruptions are underappreciated as civilizational risks <|endoftext|>
starlink now available in countries <|endoftext|>
congrats to spacex team on record number of launches <|endoftext|>
selfdriving electric cars will be all that matters gas car without autonomy will be like riding a ho <|endoftext|>
software is the key to the future <|endoftext|>
should be a major improvement with respect to complex left turns <|endoftext|>
maybe end of this week team is working hard on it <|endoftext|>
the amount of attention on me has gone supernova which super sucks unfortunately even trivial articles about me <|endoftext|>
mostly just that the media is a click maximizing machine and <|endoftext|>
all teslas come with a free karaoke app <|endoftext|>
das baby would be a hit <|endoftext|>
the media is a clickseeking machine dressed up as a truthseeking machine <|endoftext|>
the real problem here is that has zero journalistic integrity <|endoftext|>
a picture is worth tweets <|endoftext|>
yeah that was sergey and me yesterday afternoon <|endoftext|>
singlepiece casting reduces weight greatly simplifies factory increases ride quality reduces road noise <|endoftext|>
what video games have you enjoyed most over past year or two <|endoftext|>
more evidence for the simulation <|endoftext|>
movie idea boss baby meets das boot das baby hijinks on the high seas <|endoftext|>
call them out on it i guess wsj is supposed to have a high standard <|endoftext|>
wsj has run so many bs hit pieces on me and tesla ive lost count its embarrassing <|endoftext|>
havent even had sex in ages sigh <|endoftext|>
yeah the character assassination attacks have reached a new level this year but the art <|endoftext|>
this is total bs sergey and i are friends and were at a party together last night ive only seen <|endoftext|>
ironic that disney would disparage an entire class of rodents when their main character is a rodent jealous maybe <|endoftext|>
the dark origin of the lemming mass suicide myth <|endoftext|>
sickonolfis pack of attack chihuahuas are burning up phone lines today <|endoftext|>
sub lightspeed is all thats needed to be interstellar intergalactic is tough <|endoftext|>
the media is a clickseeking machine dressed up as a truthseeking machine <|endoftext|>
this is compatible with existing religions surely god would want us to see creation <|endoftext|>
a new philosophy of the future is needed i believe it should be curiosity about the universe expand humanity to <|endoftext|>
a new philosophy of the future is needed <|endoftext|>
moreover i talked to sergey yesterday and he says neither he nor anyone he knows has talked to wsj <|endoftext|>
as a public person standard to win a defamation lawsuit against a news org is almost impossible <|endoftext|>
business insider trading is not a real publication <|endoftext|>
yeah but that was years ago <|endoftext|>
weirdly some publications still print millions of paper copies every day <|endoftext|>
of journalism is reading someone elses story on the <|endoftext|>
sickonolfi has zero journalistic integrity <|endoftext|>
much harder to make friends than enemies my skill at the latter is improving <|endoftext|>
were working super hard on but it isnt ready yet <|endoftext|>
wikipedia is losing its objectivity <|endoftext|>
i cant say for sure that starship will reach escape velocity but my hubris certainly has <|endoftext|>
we should thank farmers more <|endoftext|>
products that bring joy are rare <|endoftext|>
too early to say for sure <|endoftext|>
would be unwise to risk that it is not <|endoftext|>
more tesla commodity prices are trending down than up fwiw <|endoftext|>
inflation might be trending down <|endoftext|>
thanks for your support over the years <|endoftext|>
off to the races set to harley quinn <|endoftext|>
we live in interesting times <|endoftext|>
some people are no nonsense but personally i like a little nonsense <|endoftext|>
interaction with almost all twitter accounts seem to be much lower in recent weeks days accurate <|endoftext|>
friend made this for me years ago <|endoftext|>
try voice command open butthole on your tesla <|endoftext|>
good point time to move on from hybrid cars that was a phase <|endoftext|>
is probably a week or so away but yes people outside of california will notice improvements the most <|endoftext|>
if our reality is actually an alien soap opera our ratings would be <|endoftext|>
maybe free some people in jail for weed here too <|endoftext|>
so much water under the bridge since then <|endoftext|>
maybe twitter can become that <|endoftext|>
it sure is hard to find a news source thats accurate relevant not total <|endoftext|>
the media has strong negative bias are driven by clicks they cant help it unfortuna <|endoftext|>
thanksgiving last year after watching one too many episodes of vikings <|endoftext|>
just came across this pretty good cnbc piece on spacex starship <|endoftext|>
that estimate seems high but the point is valid <|endoftext|>
worth reading this is a close match for my philosophy <|endoftext|>
the ratio of digital to biological compute is growing fast worth tracking <|endoftext|>
a successful orbital flight is probably between and months from now <|endoftext|>
i had more kids in q than they made cars <|endoftext|>
yeah pretty good i like the name <|endoftext|>
not true tesla is mins from austin international airport would be silly to build another private airport <|endoftext|>
hustling to get starship booster back to pad to test outer ring of engines <|endoftext|>
thank goodness for senator manchin <|endoftext|>
less than of twitter daily users are fakespam <|endoftext|>
i hereby challenge to a public debate about the twitter bot percentage let him prove to the publ <|endoftext|>
good question why arent they <|endoftext|>
good summary of the problem if twitter simply provides their method of sampling accounts and how the <|endoftext|>
i love the smell of hydraulic fluid in the morning <|endoftext|>
moving rocket to launch pad <|endoftext|>
growing at year requires an insane amount of work but is achievable with outstanding execution <|endoftext|>
this release will be big <|endoftext|>
yes in the hopefully unlikely event that twitter forces this deal to close and some equity pa <|endoftext|>
tesla fremont team is kicking a <|endoftext|>
coming soon part is about scaling sustainable energy at a civilizational level to enable a bright future for earth <|endoftext|>
tesla mile range semi truck starts shipping this year cybertruck next year <|endoftext|>
about to attempt long duration engine firing to test autogenous pressurization <|endoftext|>
true i already get audited every year by default <|endoftext|>
i think the approved language these days is heightchallenged sellers <|endoftext|>
thanks but i already have one <|endoftext|>
because tesla doesnt advertise and other car companies do <|endoftext|>
the guardian swallows scam video hook line sinker <|endoftext|>
they had a good run humanity has a long way to go to equal their time on earth <|endoftext|>
this will be mars one day <|endoftext|>
but have u seen my sex tape <|endoftext|>
would be pretty wild if a car company made the most powerful supercomputer on earth <|endoftext|>
well phase in dojo wont need to buy as many incremental gpus next year <|endoftext|>
waitlist is too long will enable again as we ramp production <|endoftext|>
another orbital plane of polar satellites <|endoftext|>
strange that this receives very little attention in the media <|endoftext|>
k from one border crossing in less than a year <|endoftext|>
congrats giga shanghai on making millionth car total teslas made now over m <|endoftext|>
production is a much bigger challenge than demand <|endoftext|>
i hope there is a selfsustaining city on mars in years <|endoftext|>
yes tesla autopilotai team is doing amazing work will be worth its name <|endoftext|>
almost all of earths energy comes from the sun already we would be a dark iceball at near absolute <|endoftext|>
although if it were any team it would be man u they were my fav team as a kid <|endoftext|>
and im not buying cocacola to put the cocaine back in despite the extreme popularity of such a move <|endoftext|>
no this is a longrunning joke on twitter im not buying any sports teams <|endoftext|>
got to build those youtube subscriptions <|endoftext|>
note we are trying to reduce delivery times as quickly as possible long wait times are not a good thing <|endoftext|>
yeah thats what i mean <|endoftext|>
also im buying manchester united ur welcome <|endoftext|>
the downside of elf ear surgery probably outweighs the upside <|endoftext|>
to be clear i support the left half of the republican party and the right half of the democratic party <|endoftext|>
ok well turn it on <|endoftext|>
for some reason i just agree with that guy so much <|endoftext|>
i will seek out one of these mars bars tomorrow <|endoftext|>
being a mom is just as important as any career <|endoftext|>
those are the questions that twitter is doing everything possible to avoid answering <|endoftext|>
modifying your car after delivery is legal in america so yes <|endoftext|>
that said we will add autoconfigure to side mirrors <|endoftext|>
side mirrors cause range reduction at highway speed <|endoftext|>
yes but side mirrors wont be needed in a selfdriving future <|endoftext|>
might need a new po box after tweeting this <|endoftext|>
nice letter from bill nix who wouldve been my prof at stanford if i hadnt put grad studies on permanent deferm <|endoftext|>

there are many major code changes so this will be an extra cautious rollout releasing o <|endoftext|>
worth hearing about tesla autopilot softwareai progress <|endoftext|>
as mentioned previously this is a major release so we need to be cautious goes out to beta participants later today <|endoftext|>
neuralink progress update show tell on october st halloween <|endoftext|>
main goals this year starship to orbit fsd wide release many other things of course but those are the <|endoftext|>
it is the fastest way to get between one downtown and another with known physics and the standard model is proving quiet resilient <|endoftext|>
would be cool to do a much simplified hyperloop demo tunnel between maybe austin san antonio <|endoftext|>
now tunnels are in active use in vegas try it if youre in town will be expanding to connect all m <|endoftext|>
funny how there are often simultaneous reactions saying its impossible and it was already done years ago <|endoftext|>
glad its working out thanks for giving us this tough case to solve thats what field testin <|endoftext|>
just wanted to emphasize again that our awesome tesla softwareai team is who really deserves <|endoftext|>
note you can upgrade your existing car to fsd in mins via the tesla app <|endoftext|>
after wide release of fsd beta price of fsd will rise to k in north america on september th current <|endoftext|>
fsd beta started rolling out to tesla owners last night this build is a big step forward probably <|endoftext|>
tesla autopilotai team did great work with some point releases needed for polish so should really shine <|endoftext|>
the course of civilization is not always upward <|endoftext|>
mechazilla loads starship on launchpad <|endoftext|>
is in limited release for a reason please do not ask to be included in early beta releases and then complain <|endoftext|>
so spam prevalence was shared with the board but the board chose not disclose that to the public <|endoftext|>
in case anyone feels like buying a fine whistle <|endoftext|>
youre waking up in the morning <|endoftext|>
i would gladly obey their commands but i cant tell what theyre saying <|endoftext|>
i do not doubt that criticism public or private is welcome after we go to wide beta <|endoftext|>
no let me make something clear james contacted me directly to be included in early <|endoftext|>
and i do think global warming is a major risk <|endoftext|>
population collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming <|endoftext|>
note connectivity will be to mbits per cell zone so will work great for texting voice calls but not high bandwidth <|endoftext|>
starlink v launching next year will transmit direct to mobile phones eliminating dead zones worldwide <|endoftext|>
livestream of big news in about an hour <|endoftext|>
releases monday night about a week or so later this will be the wide beta version <|endoftext|>
the caffeine one is most troubling <|endoftext|>
some are indeed sadly antihuman <|endoftext|>
countries should be increasing nuclear power generation it is insane from a national security standpoint bad for <|endoftext|>
it is safe to say that our output will not exceed the mass of the known universe <|endoftext|>
similarly high cycle life with nickel cathode is possible if optimizing for that adding silicon to <|endoftext|>
that plus pessimism about the future false overpopulation fears <|endoftext|>
please share some things in this thread which are working for you in life that others may find helpful <|endoftext|>
yeah i lift a little <|endoftext|>
over lbs down from my unhealthy peak weight <|endoftext|>
from time to time i will share some things that seem to be working for me in case you find it helpful <|endoftext|>
the zero fasting app is quite good <|endoftext|>
on advice of a good friend ive been fasting periodically feel healthier <|endoftext|>
yes but ive done a lot with the place <|endoftext|>

getting to orbit back is harder than it may seem <|endoftext|>
it will grow by at least to meters over time <|endoftext|>
first few days just k owners but going to k if no major issues note hopefully goin <|endoftext|>
good to ask yourself this often <|endoftext|>
agreed we recently made this change many others an intense effort is underway to achieve robust <|endoftext|>
this will happen again just a matter of time <|endoftext|>

is even better we reduced latency jitter in hardware command loop so <|endoftext|>
kickass internet connection coming royal caribbean ships soon <|endoftext|>
on a bot basis this deal is awesome <|endoftext|>
i intend to do so as soon as possible <|endoftext|>
yeah aiming for up to flights next year <|endoftext|>

tolkien is turning in his grave <|endoftext|>
has a relatively small number of code changes but their practical effect will be significant <|endoftext|>
it will probably help proportionate to the cost of raising children <|endoftext|>
more solar batteries needed batteries are great at dealing with peak demand <|endoftext|>
i accept of cookies but if choc chip <|endoftext|>
if twitter put as much effort into botspam removal as they do into subpoenas we wouldnt have this p <|endoftext|>
we have advised all potential witnesses to provide full cooperation to the court but we do not control their actions <|endoftext|>

those who claim any criticism of rings of power means youre racist are outing themselves as closet racists <|endoftext|>
weve had some promising conversations with apple about starlink connectivity iphone team <|endoftext|>
note i am putting a lot of time personally into advancing tesla service to make it awesome <|endoftext|>
youre right we should credit tesla owners if we change appointments with less than hours n <|endoftext|>
lot of people still dont realize tesla makes uninterruptible power supplies for your whole home powerwall <|endoftext|>
this thread brings back a lot of memories <|endoftext|>
the primary solution to a sustainable energy future is solarwind with batteries for when sun doesn <|endoftext|>
fusion would be expensive energy given difficulty of obtaining and transporting source fuel plus m <|endoftext|>

exactly ecosystem is almost entirely dependent on the sun already civil <|endoftext|>
yup theres a reason we do static fires much better to break things on the ground than en route to orbit <|endoftext|>
solar panels ground mount rooftop paired with stationary batteries will be civiliz <|endoftext|>
i love the graffiti art at giga berlin <|endoftext|>

still doing same thing but bigger <|endoftext|>
looks good to roll out to all tesla owners with k cars <|endoftext|>
that is probably the right order of magnitude <|endoftext|>
realworld validation billions of miles of realworld training are what will make fsd superhuman <|endoftext|>
fsd beta rolling out now please note that top priority is safety so expect it to be overly cautious espe <|endoftext|>
there is appetite for an infinite number of interesting tweets <|endoftext|>
the residual value of gasoline cars bought today will be much lower than people think <|endoftext|>
supercharger centers with solar batteries are the longterm vision <|endoftext|>
wont be long before we view gasoline cars the same way we view steam engines today <|endoftext|>
socrates can be a little boring tbh <|endoftext|>
our view of reality is always wrong just a question of how wrong <|endoftext|>

anyone know who the secret clients are lets out them on twitter rn haha <|endoftext|>
im testing it today in palo alto <|endoftext|>
this was harder than reaching volume production which was insanely hard <|endoftext|>

big improvement in high speed crosstraffic velocity nn coming next month <|endoftext|>

how ironic thats what henrik fisker did to tesla in karma is a <|endoftext|>
they need to add a lot of batteries to the grid to buffer energy <|endoftext|>

note this event is meant for recruiting ai robotics engineers so will be highly technical <|endoftext|>
naturally there will be a catgirl version of our optimus robot <|endoftext|>
the point of ai day is to show the immense depth breadth of tesla in ai compute hardware robotics <|endoftext|>
should be according to greatest need not race or anything else <|endoftext|>
tesla ai day starts at precisely pm california time <|endoftext|>
tesla team is awesome such an honor to work with them <|endoftext|>
i still love the epic plane <|endoftext|>
recording of tesla ai day <|endoftext|>
that and giving it a brain <|endoftext|>
uh oh mine must be tiny <|endoftext|>

do not let ancient grudge break to new mutiny <|endoftext|>
so many talented russians in america <|endoftext|>
customer experience suffers when there is an end of quarter rush steady as she goes is the right move <|endoftext|>
war always gives ample reason for vengeance for all sides only by overcoming this instinct can there be peace <|endoftext|>
smoothing out crazy end of quarter delivery wave to reduce expedite costs relieve stress on tesla <|endoftext|>
its funny reading simultaneous criticism that its already been done but also its impossible <|endoftext|>
thanks we have a great team <|endoftext|>
a small number of terminals were paid for by the govt vast majority were not this is ju <|endoftext|>
i still very much support ukraine but am convinced that massive escalation of the war will cause grea <|endoftext|>
we gave starlinks to ukraine lost m in doing so while putting spacex myself at serious risk of <|endoftext|>
spacexs out of pocket cost to enable support starlink in ukraine is m so far our support for ru <|endoftext|>
in other news remote controlled anal beads sold out everywhere <|endoftext|>
that referendum was questionable which is why i suggested repeating it un <|endoftext|>
great offer a un supervised vote and if russia refuses then war it is <|endoftext|>
maybe a similar approach to kosovo <|endoftext|>
no im suggesting voting under un or pick your most trusted entity or country supervision <|endoftext|>
russia is doing partial mobilization they go to full war mobilization if crimea is at risk death o <|endoftext|>
you are assuming that i wish to be popular i dont care i do care that millions of people may die <|endoftext|>
lets try this then the will of the people who live in the donbas crimea should decide whether theyre part of russia or ukraine <|endoftext|>
indeed biggest bot attack ive ever seen <|endoftext|>
the bot attack on this poll is strong <|endoftext|>
the will of the people should decide whether they are part of russia or ukraine but russia invaded a <|endoftext|>
also worth noting that a possible albeit unlikely outcome from this conflict is nuclear war <|endoftext|>
this is highly likely to be the outcome in the end just a question of how many die before then <|endoftext|>
ukrainerussia peace redo elections of annexed regions under un supervision russia leaves if that is will of t <|endoftext|>
that is my assessment too <|endoftext|>
wellsaid also we try to operate the team as nonhierarchically as possible allow movement between p <|endoftext|>
im trying my hardest perhaps more people might consider loving <|endoftext|>
would be cool to make a game using tesla sim thats literally your city neighborhood down to skid <|endoftext|>
and people wonder why i sometimes think were in a simulation <|endoftext|>
twitter probably accelerates x by to years but i could be wrong <|endoftext|>
buying twitter is an accelerant to creating x the everything app <|endoftext|>
should be noted that starlink is still far from cash flow positive all leo communications constella <|endoftext|>
that wouldnt be hard to do <|endoftext|>
twitter is an accelerant to fulfilling the original vision <|endoftext|>
i do not think it is simple at all but i have yet to hear any realistic path to peace ukraine h <|endoftext|>
will actually be a major upgrade were keeping just because haha <|endoftext|>
starlink view of nd stage deorbit burn <|endoftext|>
i will try my best <|endoftext|>
im a big fan of ukraine but not of ww <|endoftext|>
cute you can get surprisingly close to a wild baby rhino mom if you stay downwind <|endoftext|>
there are no angels in war <|endoftext|>
so theyre saying that not buying twitter is bad but also buying twitter is bad <|endoftext|>
we talked via videoconference last year <|endoftext|>
war is the ultimate supreme court <|endoftext|>
kherson and zaporizhzhia almost certainly do not want to join russia annexation of thos <|endoftext|>
obviously not everyone who voted for the prorussia party wanted to join russia but it would als <|endoftext|>
below is the electoral map of blue is the prorussia party <|endoftext|>
assuming you believe that the will of the people matters we should in any given conflict region <|endoftext|>
first of all tesla hasnt had that consumer tax credit for years we didnt ask for this one gm ford did <|endoftext|>
another batch of starlinks in orbit hours after the astronaut launch <|endoftext|>
cant wait to see this beast in action <|endoftext|>
even better build coming next week <|endoftext|>
quite a few trying to <|endoftext|>

bad reporting by ft this article falsely claims that starlink termin <|endoftext|>
starlink will provide the vast majority of bandwidth from space <|endoftext|>
youd need an electric propeller mounted on the tow hitch to go faster than a few knots there m <|endoftext|>
in case you missed tesla ai day <|endoftext|>
satellite constellation capability comes down to tonnage to orbit per year times capability per ton <|endoftext|>

i have no desire to become involved in wars but it is safe to say that all bets are off if the nukes start flying <|endoftext|>
strong candidate to win most counterintuitive product of the year <|endoftext|>
important to bear in mind when reading anything <|endoftext|>
indeed that kinetic energy scales with the square of velocity is not wellappreciated a sealed escape <|endoftext|>
there are k terminals in ukraine but each terminal can be used to provide an internet u <|endoftext|>
too busy trying to survive at the time <|endoftext|>
they were invited to further their career elsewhere <|endoftext|>
there is a giant ft literal fork in the road outside the autopilot office in palo alto <|endoftext|>
i love the inverse poetry of making metaphors literal <|endoftext|>
that is quite an interesting story we sent what appeared to be identical emails to all but each wa <|endoftext|>
nuclear war probability is rising rapidly <|endoftext|>
an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind <|endoftext|>
perhaps we can talk again today <|endoftext|>
true starlink provided a decisive battlefield advantage <|endoftext|>
ive been up all night trying to think of any possible way to deescalate this war <|endoftext|>
feels so long ago a pleasant memory <|endoftext|>
sam there is a such a thing as meditating too much <|endoftext|>
yes back to regularly scheduled programming <|endoftext|>
pointless as there is currently no overlap between russian and ukrainian demands its not even close <|endoftext|>
no it is not i have spoken to putin only once and that was about months ago the subject matter was space <|endoftext|>
talked to ye today expressed my concerns about his recent tweet which i think he took to heart <|endoftext|>
it was built paid for at my request hunter team did great work <|endoftext|>
my opinion is burnt hair is just elon saying chill out have a laugh and share a laugh <|endoftext|>
we might need a different name as this is basically just starlink with roaming capability so you can take your te <|endoftext|>
the counterintuitive thing is that its actually gonna be a sick product <|endoftext|>
please buy my perfume so i can buy twitter <|endoftext|>
youre most welcome glad to support ukraine <|endoftext|>
doesnt get more lit than this <|endoftext|>
be the change you want in the world <|endoftext|>
cant wait for media stories tomorrow about m of burnt hair sold <|endoftext|>
bottles of burnt hair sold <|endoftext|>
over bottles of burnt hair sold <|endoftext|>
with a name like mine getting into the fragrance business was inevitable why did i even fight it for so long <|endoftext|>
and you can pay with doge <|endoftext|>
the finest fragrance on earth <|endoftext|>
maybe one day we can finally achieve <|endoftext|>
the next question one is typically asked is have you tried ayahuasca <|endoftext|>
vital to the future of consciousness <|endoftext|>
envy has driven him to madness <|endoftext|>
starlink requires nothing except watt power source with a small solar system plus battery or a ge <|endoftext|>
there are some active terminals <|endoftext|>
of course this happens almost every day they successfully destroyed viasa <|endoftext|>
starlink has faced relentless jamming attacks spacex relentless cyberwar <|endoftext|>
starlink data usage growth in ukraine <|endoftext|>
people should never fear turbulence commercial airliner wings can handle insane amounts of bending <|endoftext|>
the right question to ask <|endoftext|>
were just following his recommendation <|endoftext|>
falcon can probably get starlink past breakeven but starship is needed to fund mars <|endoftext|>
in addition to terminals we have to create launch maintain replenish sat <|endoftext|>
also starlink is still losing money it is insanely difficult for a leo communications constellatio <|endoftext|>
very few in iran so far <|endoftext|>
strange that nothing was leaked about our competitors in space launch communications lockheed b <|endoftext|>
spacex is not asking to recoup past expenses but also cannot fund the existing system indef <|endoftext|>
russia has the ability to destroy usa europe utterly with nuclear missiles in less than minutes <|endoftext|>
internet fiber phone lines cell towers other spacebased comms <|endoftext|>
thank you for clarifying this <|endoftext|>
starlink is the primary communications system of the <|endoftext|>
big difference between peace comms vs warfront comms starlink is <|endoftext|>
are there citizens of nations who are helping ukraine on this list <|endoftext|>
but surely no reasonable person would launch nuclear war the problem with that logic is if we were d <|endoftext|>
is this list real whats the url <|endoftext|>
we are proceeding very carefully if there is a rud on the pad starship progress will be set back by months <|endoftext|>
game over when not if earth gets hit by an object of that size <|endoftext|>
used a lot in rocketry <|endoftext|>
every millipede has its millennia <|endoftext|>
we should bring back their outfits <|endoftext|>

pitching my idea once again for a crossover of das boot boss baby das baby hijinks on the high seas <|endoftext|>
just a scratch we can buff it out <|endoftext|>
the comments in this thread are a conspiracy theorists wet dream <|endoftext|>
definitely one of the strangest meetings ive ever experienced was there too <|endoftext|>
im trying my hardest to deescalate this situation and obviously failing <|endoftext|>
damned if you do damned if you dont so guess im just damned <|endoftext|>
starship nextgen starlink satellites are key but much risk lies ahead before those are working at scale <|endoftext|>
the hilarious thing is youre not wrong <|endoftext|>
even so we should still do good deeds <|endoftext|>
the hell with it even though starlink is still losing money other companies are getting billions of taxpayer <|endoftext|>
that dude is not just a condition of anonymity spineless coward hes also an ignorant fool star <|endoftext|>
it has required a lot of our resources going into super lockdown mode slows <|endoftext|>
dod provided about of the falcon development cost appreciated certainly but should be seen in context <|endoftext|>
of course and their signal jamming systems are also getting better <|endoftext|>
the amount spacex is requesting for a major battlefield advantage is less than the cost of one new gps <|endoftext|>
would be great if someday humanity stopped pointing nukes at itself that would destroy almost all life <|endoftext|>
wrong analogy america also had a humiliating withdra <|endoftext|>
russia has been punched in the nose and forced to retreat many ti <|endoftext|>
obviously many disagree with this logic but what do they think is their probability of b <|endoftext|>
but hey look on the bright side at least russia doesnt get crimea in that scenario s <|endoftext|>
if russia faces destruction of their army and utter defeat by nato they will use nukes <|endoftext|>
whether one likes it or not crimea is absolutely seen as a core part of russia by russia crimea <|endoftext|>
if russia is faced with the choice of losing crimea or using battlefield nukes they will choose the <|endoftext|>
standard nonperformance y suspension in production now has improve <|endoftext|>
yeah rv version is lower priority than standard version you should still <|endoftext|>
ok we will add a donate option to starlink <|endoftext|>
thats oddly low normally much higher <|endoftext|>
are there others that want to donate starlinks to places in need <|endoftext|>
thats happened to me many times <|endoftext|>
a much quieter leaf blower is possible <|endoftext|>
this is harder than it sounds but ok <|endoftext|>
actually smart summon is almost done <|endoftext|>
to be precise terminals were sent to ukraine but at present only are paying for service <|endoftext|>
spacex has already withdrawn its request for funding <|endoftext|>
we even did a starlink video call on one airplane aloft to starlink on another far away airplane aloft and it wor <|endoftext|>
several major architectural upgrades in so its much more than a point release but w <|endoftext|>
definitely giving me kid naming ideas <|endoftext|>
internet in airplanes will feel same as if you were accessing internet at home <|endoftext|>
bottles of exquisite burnt hair perfume already sold only left of this unique limited edition col <|endoftext|>
were working on it hope to release something next week <|endoftext|>
no money from dod but several other countries orgs individuals are paying for kk terminals <|endoftext|>
smart maybe does dumb stuff definitely <|endoftext|>
should i make weapons ideally not <|endoftext|>
spacex has more active satellites in orbit than rest of earth combined tracking to double rest of earth soon <|endoftext|>
the media reports with great fanfare my predictions that are late but rarely those that come early <|endoftext|>
accelerating sustainable energy is our primary mission <|endoftext|>
will require truly exceptional execution but it is possible <|endoftext|>
i will not let you down no matter what it takes <|endoftext|>
youre right eventually we all run out of time <|endoftext|>
only giga berlin can make these colors as paint shop was specially built to apply many fine layers of paint givin <|endoftext|>
varies a lot tesla spacex are in good positions but many other companies are not re <|endoftext|>
those who want putin removed are laboring under the misappre <|endoftext|>
russia overrunning ukraine would destabilize the entire region perhaps the world <|endoftext|>
if russia faced calamitous defeat in conventional warfare for something as strategically c <|endoftext|>
still very unlikely but this is the closest weve been since cuba in <|endoftext|>
just guessing but probably until spring of <|endoftext|>
it sure would be nice to have one year without a horrible global event <|endoftext|>
brutal for both sides will be a common phrase in the months to come <|endoftext|>
btw hows it going in bakhmut <|endoftext|>
british humor is the best <|endoftext|>
compromise is overwhelmingly the most likely outcome just a question of how much d <|endoftext|>
that should be the nature of the debate <|endoftext|>
most probable outcome by far is a horrible war of attrition that destroys ukraine severely d <|endoftext|>
congrats to team on th launch this year falcon now holds record for most launches of a single vehicle type in a year <|endoftext|>
there is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye <|endoftext|>
why are you perpetuating propaganda concocted by the oil gas industry to distract you from the tr <|endoftext|>
switzerland belgium have great chocolate but i do also love eccentric british irish artisanal sweet shops <|endoftext|>
next week its actually a major release so a lot more internal testing is needed before going to public beta <|endoftext|>
although there could be more rd in candy tbh feels like there hasnt been much improvement in decades <|endoftext|>
headline is misleading starlink can obviously offer far more robust positioning than gps as it wil <|endoftext|>
one of my favorite conspiracy theories is that the world is actually men <|endoftext|>
maybe it was a social media algorithm not even people <|endoftext|>
think about who might have decided the current thing before accepting it <|endoftext|>
who decides the current thing real question i dont know <|endoftext|>
exactly wapo are such hypocrites <|endoftext|>
neuralink show tell now on nov <|endoftext|>
weve come a long way <|endoftext|>
i know nothing is forever <|endoftext|>
this needs to change manufacturing is awesome <|endoftext|>
how exciting to be alive at the same time as the largest animal ever wild that <|endoftext|>
before dod even came back with an answer i told that spacex would not <|endoftext|>
had to do a doubletake this is the first nonfake vitalik tweet ive seen in a while <|endoftext|>
one mans hedge is another mans shrub <|endoftext|>
too much respect for authority inhibits innovation <|endoftext|>
what lesson took you the longest to unlearn <|endoftext|>
twitter should be as broadly inclusive as possible serving as a fair forum for lively even if occasi <|endoftext|>
i only play crazy s <|endoftext|>
yeah im back to spare bedroom couch surfing at friends houses in silicon val <|endoftext|>
i did as a child but found it to be too simple to be useful in real life a <|endoftext|>

while its true that kasparov is almost as good at playing chess as my iphone he is otherwise an idiot <|endoftext|>
a beautiful thing about twitter is how it empowers citizen journalism people are able to disseminate news without an establishment bias <|endoftext|>
im a big fan of citizen journalism <|endoftext|>
according to unnamed sources close to the matter who wish to remain anonymous <|endoftext|>
the new york times has emerged as a new chaotic actor in global politics the papers interventions in some of th <|endoftext|>
works on any moving land object <|endoftext|>
meeting a lot of cool people at twitter today <|endoftext|>
entering twitter hq let that sink in <|endoftext|>
definitely closer to citizen journalism local news orgs are underappreciated should get way more prominence on twitter <|endoftext|>
yes account was restored by twitter before the acquisition they did not consult with or inform me <|endoftext|>
twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints no major content decisions o <|endoftext|>
let the good times roll <|endoftext|>
i will be digging in more today <|endoftext|>
falcon rockets to orbit as seen from la <|endoftext|>
finally the truth that carbs are amazing can be said on this platform <|endoftext|>
fresh baked bread pastries are some of the great joys of life <|endoftext|>
good point being able to select which version of twitter you want is probably better much as it would b <|endoftext|>
one of the best trolls ever <|endoftext|>
something like this makes sense <|endoftext|>
to be super clear we have not yet made any changes to twitters content moderation policies <|endoftext|>
sorry about that fixing as fast as possible <|endoftext|>
ligma johnson had it coming <|endoftext|>
anyone suspended for minor dubious reasons will be freed from twitter jail <|endoftext|>
comedy is now legal on twitter <|endoftext|>
tweeps will be twits going forward as the latter has vastly more gravitas <|endoftext|>
there seem to be people managing for every one person coding <|endoftext|>
but management is such a tantalizing carrot <|endoftext|>
my title is chief twit right there in the bio no idea who the ceo is <|endoftext|>
so demanding to allow a mere days to learn this priceless information <|endoftext|>
just received this email from twitter this is an actual real email that was autogenerated <|endoftext|>
i will look into this twitter should be evenhanded favoring neither side <|endoftext|>
andrej will always be welcome at tesla <|endoftext|>

oh no all our diabolical plans have been revealed <|endoftext|>
what could we do to make it better than tiktok <|endoftext|>
weve all made some questionable tweets me more than most but i want to be clear that i support yoel <|endoftext|>
wachtell twitter board deliberately hid this evidence from the court stay tuned more to come <|endoftext|>
all news has bias some more than others <|endoftext|>
this is fake i did not tweet out a link to the new york times <|endoftext|>
ive now been through so many hero to villain cycles ive lost count <|endoftext|>
the whole verification process is being revamped right now <|endoftext|>
falcon heavy launch in mins <|endoftext|>
i will explain the rationale in longer form before this is implemented it is the only way to defeat the bots trolls <|endoftext|>
we need to pay the bills somehow twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers how about <|endoftext|>
i confess its all my fault <|endoftext|>
i recommend following for the most accurate understanding of whats happening with trust safety at twitter <|endoftext|>
i hate sarcasm so much you cant believe it <|endoftext|>
twitter has had a massive drop in revenue due to activist groups pressuring advertisers even though nothing has c <|endoftext|>
that assessment is more accurate than most people realize <|endoftext|>
unsure if confirming or denying that im an alien is more convincing that im an alien <|endoftext|>
maybe were already in it <|endoftext|>
im an alien trying to get back to my home planet <|endoftext|>
there are in fact agendas <|endoftext|>
tiny talk is talk so small it feels like its coming from your own mind <|endoftext|>
what can i say it was a naked abuse of power <|endoftext|>
why is small talk even legal <|endoftext|>
a neuron doesnt realize its a neuron <|endoftext|>
pretty much or at least one of the hive minds <|endoftext|>
with a lot of room for improvement <|endoftext|>
because it consists of billions of bidirectional interactions per day twitter can be thought of as a collective c <|endoftext|>
true twitter has amazing content in japan roughly half of all adults online but its al <|endoftext|>
your feedback is appreciated now pay <|endoftext|>
twitter is simply the most interesting place on the internet thats why youre reading this tweet right now <|endoftext|>
being attacked by both right left simultaneously is a good sign <|endoftext|>
quite a few companies like this <|endoftext|>
capital allocation should be done by those best at doing so <|endoftext|>
still a fair bit of polish to be done on its a major release posing as a minor release <|endoftext|>
you get what you pay for <|endoftext|>
if verified accounts violate terms of service eg spamscamimpersonation theyll be suspended but twitte <|endoftext|>
absolutely agreed that the twitter safety board should have people from all viewpoints <|endoftext|>
the community notes feature is awesome our goal is to make twitter the most accurate source of inform <|endoftext|>
talked to civil society leaders <|endoftext|>
twitter speaks to the inner masochist in all of us <|endoftext|>
its the users own setting that did this <|endoftext|>
totally stole idea of charging for insults arguments from monty python tbh <|endoftext|>
to all complainers please continue complaining but it will cost <|endoftext|>
that already happens very frequently <|endoftext|>
falcon heavy is a testament to the awesomeness of humanity <|endoftext|>
sounds like a good idea <|endoftext|>
there will be a secondary tag below the name for someone who is a public figure which is already the case for politicians <|endoftext|>
yes this will destroy the bots if a paid blue account engages in spamscam that account will be suspende <|endoftext|>
absolutely essential creators need to make a living <|endoftext|>
this will also give twitter a revenue stream to reward content creators <|endoftext|>
and paywall bypass for publishers willing to work with us <|endoftext|>
you will also get priority in replies mentions search which is essential to defeat spamscam ability to po <|endoftext|>
price adjusted by country proportionate to purchasing power parity <|endoftext|>
twitters current lords peasants system for who has or doesnt have a blue checkmark is bullshit power to the <|endoftext|>
twitter drives a massive number of clicks to other websitesapps biggest click dri <|endoftext|>
trash me all day but itll cost <|endoftext|>
thank you a thermonuclear name shame is exactly what will happen if this continues <|endoftext|>
regarding twitters reduction in force unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over mday <|endoftext|>
twitter will not censor accurate information about anything <|endoftext|>
again to be crystal clear twitters strong commitment to content moderation remains absolutely unchanged in fac <|endoftext|>
excellent summary of twitters trust safety from the head of the team <|endoftext|>
hank try a google search <|endoftext|>
and therefore twitter should die <|endoftext|>
fixing search is a high priority <|endoftext|>
search within twitter reminds me of infoseek in that will also get a lot better pronto <|endoftext|>
mins to start then several hours in a month or so <|endoftext|>
we definitely need to incent people to do a lot more interactions on twitter <|endoftext|>
we can do min chunks at resolution now for new blue so you could break up a longer video <|endoftext|>
hopefully less than a month <|endoftext|>
followed by creator monetization for all forms of content <|endoftext|>
twitter will soon add ability to attach longform text to tweets ending absurdity of notepad screenshots <|endoftext|>
great question twitter will suspend the account attempting impersonation and keep the money so i <|endoftext|>
so long as pay please be my guest <|endoftext|>
that is weirdly tricky due to the way apple handles subscriptions <|endoftext|>
hot take not everything aoc says is accurate <|endoftext|>
this feature is an absolute gamechanger for fighting misdisinformation at scale <|endoftext|>
as soon as we confirm its working well in the initial set of countries and we have the transl <|endoftext|>
making great actuators for a humanoid robot is a surprisingly hard problem <|endoftext|>
i still do a lot of work at tesla was at our palo alto engineering office until late thursday night w <|endoftext|>
far too many legacy verified checkmarks were handed out often arbitrarily so in reality they are not <|endoftext|>
birdwatch soon to be renamed community notes has incredible potential for improving info <|endoftext|>
hardcore democrats or republicans never vote for the other side so independent voters are the ones who actually decide whos in charge <|endoftext|>
to independentminded voters shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties therefore i recommend voting <|endoftext|>
but if twitter is bird thats means <|endoftext|>
back when birds were real <|endoftext|>
twitter rules will evolve over time but theyre currently the following <|endoftext|>
birds havent been real since <|endoftext|>
not everything needs to have bird in the name too many bird groups fighting each internally other at twitter angry birds <|endoftext|>
birdwatch gives me the creeps <|endoftext|>
but if she really wants her account back she can have it <|endoftext|>
actually she was suspended for impersonating a comedian <|endoftext|>
at the end of the day if twitter is indeed the most accurate source of information more people will use it <|endoftext|>
as judged by the people of twitter via community notes formerly birdwatch <|endoftext|>
you represent the problem journalists who think they are the only source of legitimate information thats the big lie <|endoftext|>
i will look into this <|endoftext|>
my commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane even though that is a direct personal safety risk <|endoftext|>
twitter needs to become by far the most accurate source of information about the world thats our mission <|endoftext|>
twitter user numbers have increased significantly around the world since the deal was announced and <|endoftext|>
no problem to use a pseudonym the highlevel principle is just that verified users cant e <|endoftext|>
we are implementing additional safeguards to prevent impersonation as well as collective <|endoftext|>
widespread verification will democratize journalism empower the voice of the people <|endoftext|>
any name change at all will cause temporary loss of verified checkmark <|endoftext|>
previously we issued a warning before suspension but now that we are rolling out widespread verification there w <|endoftext|>
what censorship are you referring to <|endoftext|>
going forward any twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying parody will be permanently suspended <|endoftext|>
politics is war and truth is the first casualty <|endoftext|>
while its true that ive been under unfair misleading attack for some time by leading democr <|endoftext|>
i just hope the servers dont melt <|endoftext|>
twitter usage is at an alltime high lol <|endoftext|>
and im open to the idea of voting democrat again in the future <|endoftext|>
to be clear my historical party affiliation has been independent with an actual voting history of entirely democrat until this year <|endoftext|>
like most people in america i agree with some of the democrat and some of the republican policies but <|endoftext|>
when reality is indistinguishable from satire <|endoftext|>
it is borderline illegal to support republicans in san francisco even admitting you know some is pretty bad <|endoftext|>
twitter is the most interesting place on the internet <|endoftext|>
twitter is the worst but also the best <|endoftext|>
wow this is messed up <|endoftext|>
far too many corrupt legacy blue verification checkmarks exist so no choice but to remove legacy blue in coming months <|endoftext|>
i love when people complain about twitter on twitter <|endoftext|>
im not seeing much spam in this reply <|endoftext|>
its working for me that said we can definitely make the verified mentions tab more usable <|endoftext|>
what does a tosh look like <|endoftext|>
are you seeing far fewer botsscamsspam <|endoftext|>
rollout of new verified blue is intentionally limited just to ios in a few countries with very little pr <|endoftext|>
in days to come well add granularity to verified badge such as organizational affiliation id verification <|endoftext|>
we are changing the text to say legacy verified could be notable but could also be bogus <|endoftext|>
subscription blue is better than legacy blue i switched over <|endoftext|>
the goal of twitter dms is to superset signal <|endoftext|>
twitter is growing super fast i hope it continues <|endoftext|>
hopefully as soon as next week <|endoftext|>
rockets that arent reusable have no future <|endoftext|>
please note that twitter will do lots of dumb things in coming months we will keep what works change what doesnt <|endoftext|>
complaint hotline operator online please mention your complaints below <|endoftext|>
blue check will be the great leveler <|endoftext|>
should be noted that a significant percentage of these accounts are not real people but some proportion are <|endoftext|>
this is super messed up unfortunately many such things occurred at twitter even worse was done in lat <|endoftext|>
needs some tweaks but overall proceeding well <|endoftext|>
hit alltime high of active users today <|endoftext|>
will probably be tough but my companies are positioned well <|endoftext|>
we will take action in this regard <|endoftext|>
to be more precise accounts doing parody impersonations basically tricking people is not ok <|endoftext|>
going forward accounts engaged in parody must include parody in their name not just in bio <|endoftext|>
even i paid no discount <|endoftext|>
usage of twitter continues to rise one thing is for sure it isnt boring <|endoftext|>
you should be able to change your name now <|endoftext|>

mainstream media will still thrive but increased competition from citizens will cause them to be more accurate as <|endoftext|>
this is from the video arcade bar area <|endoftext|>
as twitter pursues the goal of elevating citizen journalism media elite will try everything to stop that from happening <|endoftext|>

btw id like to apologize for twitter being super slow in many countries app is doing poorly batched rpcs j <|endoftext|>
ultimately i think there is no choice but for twitter to be the final arbiter but im open to suggestions <|endoftext|>
rolling out soon twitter will enable organizations to identify which other twitter accounts are actually associated with them <|endoftext|>
amphetamines negatively affect empathy psychedelics do the opposite <|endoftext|>
are you suggesting the senator will abuse his political power to attack me <|endoftext|>
what matters is that you love them <|endoftext|>
i like both you and mike its just that twitter at its <|endoftext|>
and why does your pp have a mask <|endoftext|>
perhaps it is because your real account sounds like a parody <|endoftext|>
rollout will broaden roughly every week <|endoftext|>
going without saying that we all want ass actually smart summon asap <|endoftext|>
making tesla superchargers connectors available to all is the right thing to do <|endoftext|>

what could be more fun than a social network consisting entirely of hall monitors <|endoftext|>
as is obvious to all but the media there is not one permanent ban on even the most far left <|endoftext|>
it is shocking how many journalists viscously attack free speech but somehow think theyre the good guys <|endoftext|>
wait if i tweet does that count as work <|endoftext|>
pretty sure that was in elden ring <|endoftext|>
perhaps not unreasonable to know if anything was accomplished <|endoftext|>
this will improve a lot as twitter becomes fast to use outside of north america western europe japan <|endoftext|>

this is one the biggest failures in us journalistic integrity of the st century <|endoftext|>
the more i learn the worse it gets the world should know the truth of what has been happening at twitte <|endoftext|>
good point conflicts of interest should be made readily apparent to the reader <|endoftext|>
they should get a sbfaffiliated media label <|endoftext|>
thats why he wont answer <|endoftext|>
to be direct the very real concern here is that you have been pushing a completely false sbf ownership <|endoftext|>
all public holders of twitter were allowed to roll their stock into twitter as a private company but h <|endoftext|>
to be fair there are many people at twitter working late into the night for whom i have great respect <|endoftext|>
it has been really bad far left san franciscoberkeley views have been propagated to the world via <|endoftext|>
its not a real publication <|endoftext|>
with maybe a little editorial help from sbfs employees <|endoftext|>

there was a time when you cared about the truth that is long gone <|endoftext|>
as i said neither i nor twitter have taken any investment from sbfftx your article is a lie <|endoftext|>
it was getting to the point where the minimum impulse bit for a silicon valley startup was a billion dollar market cap <|endoftext|>
should twitter offer a general amnesty to suspended accounts provided that they have not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam <|endoftext|>

as a reminder i was a significant supporter of the obamabiden presidency and reluctantly voted for biden over trump <|endoftext|>
im fine with trump not tweeting the important thing is that twitter correct a grave mistake in b <|endoftext|>
i certainly hope it does not come to that but yes if there is no other choice i will make an alternative phone <|endoftext|>
calling for violence will result in suspension <|endoftext|>

this is a battle for the future of civilization if free speech is lost even in america tyranny is all that lies ahead <|endoftext|>
absolutely especially if done in collusion with the government <|endoftext|>
the twitter files on free speech suppression soon to be published on twitter itself the public deserves to know what really happened <|endoftext|>
why are so many in the media against free speech this is messed up <|endoftext|>
a revolution against online censorship in america <|endoftext|>
wow they dont sound biased at all <|endoftext|>
did you know apple puts a secret tax on everything you buy through their app store <|endoftext|>
apple has also threatened to withhold twitter from its app store but wont tell us why <|endoftext|>
secret suppression of free speech by apple customers were never told what the hell is going on here <|endoftext|>
apple should publish all censorship actions it has taken that affect its customers <|endoftext|>
are you suggesting apple would use its duopolist powers to hurt tesla <|endoftext|>
who else has apple censored <|endoftext|>
apple has mostly stopped advertising on twitter do they hate free speech in america <|endoftext|>
greetings im musket elon musket <|endoftext|>
hearting things that you just want to highlight is questionable <|endoftext|>
there is no excuse for my lack of coasters <|endoftext|>

trend is concerning fed needs to cut interest rates immediately they are massively amplifying th <|endoftext|>
much more but i am simply stating the obvious <|endoftext|>
were implementing antibot bots you should see some improvement by tomorrow <|endoftext|>
twitter core services latency reduced by ms should feel noticeably faster <|endoftext|>
sam lost me when he said that any lies at all would justify trump losing i mean sa <|endoftext|>
a little more progress to mars <|endoftext|>
several other major democrat politicians attacked me too all around the same time it was coordinated <|endoftext|>
sam used to be so rational there is such a thing as too much meditation <|endoftext|>
dont love the name but the drink itself is amazing brings me joy <|endoftext|>
this is a serious problem <|endoftext|>
if community notes can correct me then obviously they can correct anyone this is a good example they were right to add the label <|endoftext|>
i think i have been very specific <|endoftext|>
its a real problem apple and google effectively control access to most of the internet via their app stores <|endoftext|>
that one was real too <|endoftext|>
the reason satire about cnn proposing censorship of twitter could so easily be cons <|endoftext|>
this will forever be our top priority <|endoftext|>
always wondered about that bear <|endoftext|>
twitter is purging a lot of spamscam accounts right now so you may see your follower count drop <|endoftext|>
we are now confident that the neuralink device is ready for humans so timing is a function of working <|endoftext|>

how many views do your tweets get <|endoftext|>
we arent doing well at surfacing tweets from less prominent handles as its almost impossible to <|endoftext|>
ai is getting really good <|endoftext|>
exactly thats why im encouraging people to interact with twitter more <|endoftext|>
compared to ai progress with neuralink will be slow and easy to assess as there is large regulat <|endoftext|>
view count will show how many people actually see tweets just as is done for videos you w <|endoftext|>
the problem is that likes are public subjecting people to criticism and like is often t <|endoftext|>
twitter will start showing view count for all tweets just as view count is shown for all videos the syste <|endoftext|>
have you clicked on your tweet analytics little bar graph those who read tweets outnumber those who re <|endoftext|>
i meet so many people who read twitter every day but almost never tweet if i may beg your indulgence please add <|endoftext|>
lot of people stuck in a damnthatscrazy chatgpt loop <|endoftext|>
there still isnt a good strawberry picking robot but researchers are working on it as they apply ai t <|endoftext|>
as a reminder tap the stars icon on upper right of screen to switch between latest people you follow and recommended tweets <|endoftext|>
twitter acting by itself to suppress free speech is not a st amendment violation but actin <|endoftext|>
if this isnt a violation of the constitutions first amendment what is <|endoftext|>
it was an honor to see you again looking forward to exciting plans in france <|endoftext|>

what really happened with the hunter biden story suppression by twitter will be published on twitter at pm et <|endoftext|>
both false positives and negatives matter <|endoftext|>
please screenshot examples that twitter needs to fix <|endoftext|>
not counting those behind the see more replies aka probable spam button <|endoftext|>
major twitter system improvements were implemented this week to drop hammer hard on spamscam accounts taking jus <|endoftext|>
twitter is now serving almost billion tweet impressions per day just how incredibly alive the system actually <|endoftext|>
there are about m tweets per day billions of impressions so hate speech impressions are of whats seen on twitter <|endoftext|>
we will publish stats on love speech too as it is vastly higher than hate speech <|endoftext|>
hate speech impressions of times tweet was viewed continue to decline despite significant user growth <|endoftext|>
please report accounts doing so repeated harassment falls into the spam category so will result in a temp suspension <|endoftext|>
that resulted in a major spike twitter will be publishing actual hate speech same list company ha <|endoftext|>
the currently quiet majority should tweet more <|endoftext|>
you know twitter is being fair when extremists on far right and far left are simultaneously upset twitter aims to <|endoftext|>
current efficiency is kwhmile but there is a clear path to possibly <|endoftext|>

worth mentioning that tesla has opensourced its charge connector and is enabling other evs to use tesla superchargers <|endoftext|>
or you can just buy a tesla <|endoftext|>
i kinda like this post tbh <|endoftext|>
remember that flicking tigers nuts meme i posted well <|endoftext|>
the more twitter improves its signal to noise ratio the less relevant conventional news becomes <|endoftext|>
looks like we will need another day or so <|endoftext|>
pretty wild that you can engage in backandforth dialogue with over k people live on twitter spaces <|endoftext|>
and in doing so destroy their credibility <|endoftext|>
i am not expressing an opinion but did promise to conduct this poll should assange and snowden be pardoned <|endoftext|>

more importantly they said nothing about chatgpt totally at the <|endoftext|>

these are obvious account deletions with no tweets no log in for years <|endoftext|>
twitter will soon start freeing the name space of billion accounts <|endoftext|>

good way to frame it <|endoftext|>
tweets will show view count in a few weeks just like videos do twitter is much more alive than people think <|endoftext|>

any account doxxing realtime location info of anyone will be suspended as it is a physical safety violation this <|endoftext|>
realtime posting of someone elses location violates doxxing policy but delayed posting of locations are ok <|endoftext|>

one day of twitter suspension death <|endoftext|>
my plane is actually not trackable without using nonpublic data <|endoftext|>
if theyre naughty they get suspended <|endoftext|>
were fixing a legacy bug should be working tomorrow <|endoftext|>
so theyre saying its really bad to suspend people from twitter <|endoftext|>
unsuspend accounts who doxxed my exact location in realtime <|endoftext|>
sorry too many options will redo poll <|endoftext|>
if anyone posted realtime locations addresses of nyt reporters fbi would be investigating thered be hearings <|endoftext|>
unsuspend accounts who doxxed my exact location in realtime <|endoftext|>
yeah we will add that feature current system isnt clear a time <|endoftext|>
accounts engaged in doxxing receive a temporary day suspension <|endoftext|>
day suspension for doxxing some time away from twitter is good for the soul <|endoftext|>
they posted my exact realtime location basically assassination coordinates in obvious direct violat <|endoftext|>
i love barbara streisand lol <|endoftext|>
criticizing me all day long is totally fine but doxxing my realtime location and endangering my family is not <|endoftext|>
same doxxing rules apply to journalists as to everyone else <|endoftext|>
yup recent events make that super clear <|endoftext|>
twitter obviously must be fair to all so will aim to stop violent extremism being promoted by any group <|endoftext|>
changing name or profile pic causes checkmark to disappear until account is reviewed by twitt <|endoftext|>
olbermann tweeting from his dogs account still makes me lmao <|endoftext|>
quite frankly a few days away from twitter is good for their mental health <|endoftext|>

securities analysis as the riskfree real rate of return from treasury bills approaches the <|endoftext|>
twitter will start incorporating mute block signals from blue verified not legacy blue as downvotes <|endoftext|>
the people have spoken accounts who doxxed my location will have their suspension lifted now <|endoftext|>
indeed there is no other reason <|endoftext|>
such shameful behavior will not be tolerated going forward <|endoftext|>
too many people have lost faith in the future a new philosophy is needed <|endoftext|>

meanwhile twitter usage by real humans once again reaches alltime highs <|endoftext|>
rather than rigorously pursuing truth you are virtuesignaling to show that y <|endoftext|>
the danger of training ai to be woke in other words lie is deadly <|endoftext|>
bari this is a real question not rhetorical what is your opinion <|endoftext|>
twitter is not the real world <|endoftext|>
thats what they are saying <|endoftext|>
exactly same rules for all <|endoftext|>
potentially the biggest financial crisis ever <|endoftext|>
things are rather intense right now but maybe closer to christmas <|endoftext|>
what should the consequence of doxxing someones realtime exact location be <|endoftext|>
the tide is turning fast for the faucists <|endoftext|>
much has happened since then haha <|endoftext|>
much closer than they realize <|endoftext|>
wow they were truly coddled <|endoftext|>
not all journalists are that bad but far too many are <|endoftext|>
it worked like a charm lol <|endoftext|>
they think theyre better than everyone else <|endoftext|>
congrats to spacex team on perfect orbital launches within hours <|endoftext|>
in addition twitter will make it easier to see tweets from just those you follow as well as other tweet curations <|endoftext|>
wikipedia is overly controlled by mainstream media <|endoftext|>
if a group of accounts engages in brigading the entire group of accounts will get a credibility score of <|endoftext|>
if an account engages in largescale blocking the value of a block signal from that account will trend to zero <|endoftext|>
a two day suspension of maybe accounts for doxxing got an actual wikipedia page wikipedia <|endoftext|>
to be clear all user actions will factor into a nn model for a tweet and the account tweeting including positive <|endoftext|>
the question is not finding a ceo the question is finding a ceo who can keep twitter alive <|endoftext|>
should i step down as head of twitter i will abide by the results of this poll <|endoftext|>
going forward there will be a vote for major policy changes my apologies wont happen again <|endoftext|>
pauls account will be restored shortly <|endoftext|>
policy will be adjusted to suspending accounts only when that accounts primary purpose is <|endoftext|>
what do you think should be the policy <|endoftext|>
casually sharing occasional links is fine but no more relentless advertising of competitors <|endoftext|>

temp suspension due to prior doxxing action by this account will be lifted shortly <|endoftext|>
agreed a high priority software update for twitter is showing the reason for account suspension or deb <|endoftext|>
because theyre in on it <|endoftext|>
they abandon even the pretense of noble principles in their zeal to keep their monopoly on information seen by the public <|endoftext|>
there will be multiple algorithms including no algorithm ie just tweets from those you follow in chronological order <|endoftext|>

in simple terms as bank savings account interest rates which are guaranteed start to approach <|endoftext|>
go back and read your old securities analysis textbook <|endoftext|>
tweets that are interesting or entertaining get traction thats why writers tend to do well on twitter <|endoftext|>
please tell us your great ideas ross <|endoftext|>
this has gone too far to say the least what is your explanation for this madness <|endoftext|>
why has the mainstream media refused to report on this <|endoftext|>
interesting suggest that maybe we might still have an itsy bitsy bot problem on twitter <|endoftext|>
newspapers just search the internet and print it out sjm <|endoftext|>
as outgoing chair of house intelligence did you approve hidden state censorship in direct violation of the const <|endoftext|>
if you know the solution is a whole number doing mental cube approximations guessing works great <|endoftext|>

government paid twitter millions of dollars to censor info from the public <|endoftext|>
other social media companies too not just twitter <|endoftext|>

for a moment there i almost considered not giving him stars <|endoftext|>
im in favor of a small spending bill to keep things running but common sense suggests that it be the least amount <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear this it is a sobering reminder of the difficulty of orbital space flight <|endoftext|>
tweets are read times more than they are liked <|endoftext|>
looking into it that tweet doesnt violate tos <|endoftext|>
everyone just like video view count <|endoftext|>
its not out of the question <|endoftext|>
but shouldnt there be some funding in this bill to secure us borders given that we <|endoftext|>
twitter is rolling out view count so you can see how many times a tweet has been seen this is normal for video <|endoftext|>
what utter insanity that tens of billions are being spent for border security of other countries but none for ours <|endoftext|>
at the risk of being repetitive these fed rate increases might go down in history as most damaging ever <|endoftext|>
should we keep it going <|endoftext|>
that and several major ui improvements coming in jan <|endoftext|>
to be clear i am overall very much pro fbi the agency does a great deal of important work protecting <|endoftext|>
st peters is an incredible work of art <|endoftext|>
twitter votes for the right haha <|endoftext|>
dan is basically an unpaid intern on our qa team lol <|endoftext|>
interesting allowing a user to make any given like public or private is coming <|endoftext|>
views shows how alive twitter is and hopefully encourages people to tweet more often <|endoftext|>
do you prefer your nightmare rectangle with cm or cm radius corners <|endoftext|>
so youre saying you prefer the right heheh <|endoftext|>
spaces should automatically ask the host if theyd like to save it <|endoftext|>
instagram is an underpaid online modeling agency <|endoftext|>
there definitely need to be more reactions <|endoftext|>
likes should be private by default <|endoftext|>
ny times is simply outputting short summaries of articles which then hit a paywall f <|endoftext|>
civilization has been around for the blink of an eye so far <|endoftext|>
there is great danger in training an ai to lie <|endoftext|>
false it is still there <|endoftext|>
we should think of various explanations for any given event in terms of probabilities not certainties <|endoftext|>
well tidy up the esthetics add a setting to turn it off but i think almost everyone will grow to like it <|endoftext|>
the message is actually still up this is fake news twitter doesnt prevent suicide <|endoftext|>
even after i disconnected one of the more sensitive server racks <|endoftext|>
and yet work it does <|endoftext|>
is what it feels like understanding how twitter works <|endoftext|>
no special treatment for corpo journalists anymore <|endoftext|>
fractal of rube goldberg machines <|endoftext|>
i was invited to wef but declined <|endoftext|>
true progressive professors are the root of this evil <|endoftext|>
you can also now play all steam games on the latest model sx cars <|endoftext|>
luck is the greatest superpower <|endoftext|>
great work by falcon team <|endoftext|>
merry christmas good cheer to all <|endoftext|>
twitter isnt secure yet just not in the fast lane to bankruptcy still much work to do <|endoftext|>
those are definitely the most absurd predictions ive ever heard while also showing astonishing l <|endoftext|>
ted is linking to misleading data <|endoftext|>
approaching starlinks active in iran <|endoftext|>
many of whom were of course actively suppressed on twitter <|endoftext|>
much more to the twitter files covid editon than this introductory thread followup piece to come next week fea <|endoftext|>
mind virus got you you dont realize it <|endoftext|>
i invite to correct or amend this thread <|endoftext|>
exactly why would anyone trust corpo journalism <|endoftext|>
the legacy media should worry about its reputation we have only just begun <|endoftext|>
no matter how smart someone is they are always some wrong <|endoftext|>
despite these glaring issues twitter nonetheless had an internal slack channel unironically called fauci fan club <|endoftext|>
gainoffunction in this context is just another way of saying bioweapon some good nuggets in articl <|endoftext|>
almost no one seems to realize that the head of bioethics at nih the person who is supposed to make sure <|endoftext|>
even solar plus batteries on a small section of spain would solve eu energy needs <|endoftext|>
im open to the idea <|endoftext|>
how did this shift happen feels like the conventional media used to be more balanced <|endoftext|>
yeah legacy media just tell you what you already learned on twitter se <|endoftext|>
why is corporate journalism rushing to defend the state instead of the people <|endoftext|>
dont be the clown on the clown car too late haha <|endoftext|>
hope your situation gets better soon <|endoftext|>
people on twitter should like things more <|endoftext|>
most people dont appreciate the significance of the point matt was making every social m <|endoftext|>
may it always be so it is the most treasured item on my bedside table <|endoftext|>
they never had my name either <|endoftext|>
the sheer amount of brand awareness achieved by greta within a few years is astounding i think shes cool tbh <|endoftext|>
better hustle with the mars rockets <|endoftext|>
their fiction isnt even good <|endoftext|>
that would be ironic since i am literally the single biggest supp <|endoftext|>
byotp lol it was true for half a day <|endoftext|>
my reason for declining the davos invitation was not because i thought they were engaged in diaboli <|endoftext|>
i dont think we should divide issues semirandomly into left and right tribes as it inhibits <|endoftext|>
this is neither a right nor a left issue run antivirus software in your brain <|endoftext|>
i will inquire we really need to roll out the feature showing why an <|endoftext|>
it is a very common sentiment mostly implicit sometimes explicit <|endoftext|>
maybe he just loves looking at science <|endoftext|>
cocaine does not meet that test <|endoftext|>
to assess if a drug is good whether legal or illegal the acid test is being able to say blank made me a better person <|endoftext|>
i am not endorsing drugs but i am saying that the evidence suggests that banning them is a net societal negative <|endoftext|>
banning alcohol caused the biggest rise in organized crime in american history that was dumb sa <|endoftext|>
agreed reduced competition is not good for the people <|endoftext|>
new twitter will strive to optimize unregretted userminutes <|endoftext|>
being pro humanity is speciesist <|endoftext|>
cant tell if satire or real <|endoftext|>
significant backend server architecture changes rolled out twitter should feel faster <|endoftext|>
anyone who says that questioning them is questioning science itself cannot be regarded as a scientist <|endoftext|>
new twitter policy is to follow the science which necessarily includes reasoned questioning of the science <|endoftext|>
synthetic mrna has incredible potential <|endoftext|>
im not cis you are <|endoftext|>
the ais will write each other lots of emails <|endoftext|>
yeah im not a fan of pronouns when someone is giving every possible visual cue for he or she but t <|endoftext|>
gainoffunction should be called bioweapon research as the function referred is death w <|endoftext|>
congratulations spacex falcon team on successful launches this year <|endoftext|>
free phones to report themselves and they never even call to say hi <|endoftext|>
and you have tiny testicles <|endoftext|>
more twitter files some conspiracies are actually true <|endoftext|>
easy to create folders to bookmark tweets into various categories <|endoftext|>
twitter has a bookmark function accessible through share button on tweet to read bookmarks tap profile icon t <|endoftext|>
to the best of my knowledge i have never met him nor was i at that halloween party in romania <|endoftext|>
please take both of those sentences fully to heart <|endoftext|>
tesla megapack and powerwall will make a massive difference to achieving a sustainable energy future for earth <|endoftext|>
yup should be the best deal in town <|endoftext|>
its good to switch back forth as we improve twitter ai recommended tweets lists topics will become awesome <|endoftext|>
longterm fundamentals are extremely strong shortterm market madness is unpredictable <|endoftext|>
sorry this incorrect tagging should be fixed within a month or two <|endoftext|>
ai safety is a real concern <|endoftext|>
twitter gives you immediate news from the actual sources themselves vs filtered hiddenagenda news that is days old <|endoftext|>
i wouldve expected more center <|endoftext|>
if you dont think theres at least a tiny chance youre an npc youre an npc <|endoftext|>

id like to thank the people of norway again for their incredible support of electric vehicles norway rocks <|endoftext|>
yeah this is silly i love your work <|endoftext|>
exactly i am obviously moderate wing except as viewed by the far left <|endoftext|>
sometimes its just better to make pizza at home <|endoftext|>
key test for authenticity is how someone is in live back forth discussion where canned <|endoftext|>
unlike likes bookmarks are private <|endoftext|>
not sure but after watching some of his talks online he would not be an obvious choice to play the protagonist in a movie <|endoftext|>
which is ironically obviously super racist <|endoftext|>
hope youre having a great day one things for sure it wont be boring <|endoftext|>
shelby did his best to hold back spacex <|endoftext|>
penalized for making our suv too massefficient that is bizarre <|endoftext|>
but how do they earn a profit volume <|endoftext|>
his population bomb book might the most damaging antihuman thing ever written <|endoftext|>
seems like our image recognition needs some work <|endoftext|>
months ago i was person of the year <|endoftext|>
please comment on this matter <|endoftext|>
us govt agency demanded suspension of k accounts including journalists canadian officials <|endoftext|>
if you leave out contact information names of junior employees then yes <|endoftext|>
please livestream this on twitter spaces <|endoftext|>
would be worth it to see the video lulz <|endoftext|>
another episode of the twitter files <|endoftext|>
ehrlich is mad as a hatter he is someone who regards humanity as bad in and of itself antihuman to the core <|endoftext|>
feels like we are at an inflection point <|endoftext|>
its a new world goodbye homework <|endoftext|>
public likes nonpublic likes aka bookmarks should both be included in like count bookmark button sho <|endoftext|>
the drone wars are already a big deal but we aint seen nothing yet <|endoftext|>
if i dig my grave deep enough maybe it comes out other side of earth <|endoftext|>
some habits are hard to break lol maybe i should just get bulletproof shoes <|endoftext|>
will do he is a good bot <|endoftext|>
joseph menn is a contemptible liar twitter policy has always been to suspend accounts that <|endoftext|>
journalists should do shots every time there is a negative article about me <|endoftext|>
subtle but i am beginning to suspect opinions differ on this matter if not mccarthy then seriously who <|endoftext|>
sped up trip there back again <|endoftext|>
if it is ordered by the court do we have any choice <|endoftext|>
kevin mccarthy should be speaker <|endoftext|>
necessary to make life multiplanetary <|endoftext|>
an actual jurassic park would be awesome <|endoftext|>
years later still no laws <|endoftext|>
twitter has at least million wokeys <|endoftext|>
easy swipe rightleft to move between recommended vs followed tweets rolls out later this week first part of a mu <|endoftext|>
we have a real shot at late february march launch attempt appears highly likely <|endoftext|>
its amazing to see them work in unison so much has to go right for that to happen <|endoftext|>
lol no newtons third law <|endoftext|>
the mind virus is strong in the bay area <|endoftext|>

thread on how safe tesla cars are <|endoftext|>
people on twitter should like more tweets in general <|endoftext|>
people still dont get it <|endoftext|>
tanks are a deathtrap now with neither side having air superiority youre left with infantry a <|endoftext|>
we will also be adding simple formatting features like bold underline font size later this quarter <|endoftext|>
yes these will get the same timeline screen space as other tweets but you will be able to click for more <|endoftext|>
i hope that the people of brazil are able to resolve matters peacefully <|endoftext|>
we will strive to increase the joy of twitter <|endoftext|>
new ui coming this week allowing easy switch between recommended followed recommendations will get much better later this year <|endoftext|>
this is the foundation of my philosophy <|endoftext|>
all four orbital launch pads fully loaded with rockets for the first time <|endoftext|>
please be cautious about writing articles citing unnamed sources as they are frequently false <|endoftext|>
great work by tesla team <|endoftext|>
some things that your party tells you are false and some things that the other party says are true <|endoftext|>
this seems extortionately high it also isnt clear whether all things considered a second booster helps or hurts <|endoftext|>
yes i dont like it either <|endoftext|>
most people have no idea that reality winner is a real person fate irony <|endoftext|>
maybe we should spend less time on social media <|endoftext|>
starlink in aircraft feels the same as a high speed connection on the ground <|endoftext|>
demolition man movie is becoming real <|endoftext|>
this a major problem adderall is just lowgrade speed greatly amplifies your inner ahole <|endoftext|>
this problem is extremely prevalent in academia <|endoftext|>
please post what you received on twitter <|endoftext|>

starship with its voluminous cargo bay will enable incredible space telescopes for astronomy <|endoftext|>
is it just one judge <|endoftext|>
good assessment of our goal <|endoftext|>
the higher the rates the harder the fall <|endoftext|>
ironically the company that made the first commercially viable internal combustion engine car saved the co <|endoftext|>
true the daimler investment in is actually what saved tesla <|endoftext|>
i wonder what would have happened in if the fed had raised rates instead of lowering them <|endoftext|>
easier to argue that global warming is a risk rather than a certainty but it is foolish to roll <|endoftext|>
there will probably be far more robots than humans in the future <|endoftext|>
sam has changed a lot but i suppose so have we all <|endoftext|>
nuclear is way safer than coal <|endoftext|>
is this happening a lot <|endoftext|>
does seem seriously off the rails <|endoftext|>
and thats how we will land on mars <|endoftext|>
i guess theres value to having a mixed government commercial forum of some kind wef does kinda <|endoftext|>
the s in esg stands for satanic <|endoftext|>
guess thats just how it goes <|endoftext|>
im pro vaccines in general but theres a point where the curevaccine is potentially worse <|endoftext|>
i do laugh a lot on twitter haha <|endoftext|>
sam sounds like his ayahuasca trip hasnt fully worn off <|endoftext|>
it should already feel better than the past <|endoftext|>
instagram makes people depressed twitter makes people angry which is better <|endoftext|>
brief synchronization lag between our atlanta portland data centers <|endoftext|>
bbc is at least honest that they are the british broadcasting corporation unlike many others <|endoftext|>
well your account handle is literally banthebbc haha but thats actually the point i was making stat <|endoftext|>
there are some really funny wef parody accounts although its legit hard to tell <|endoftext|>
sensible thread we shouldnt be obsessed with wefdavos but they take themselves sooo seriously <|endoftext|>
population collapse is a massive danger to the future of civilization <|endoftext|>
that is ironic indeed doubly so given that tesla model y is bestselling car in switzerland <|endoftext|>
center core moving too fast return falcon heavy is a or stage rocket but full rap <|endoftext|>
people on the right should see more left wing stuff and people on the left should see more right w <|endoftext|>
the censorship tools were created to deal with scams spam but then were turned to political purposes <|endoftext|>
exactly money is actually a set of heterogeneous databases with vast amounts of legacy code still usin <|endoftext|>
zerohedge can be jerks at times but they did nothing warranting suspension <|endoftext|>
sea water contains enough of every element to support x current civilizational needs <|endoftext|>
there should be a game show chan or davos who said it <|endoftext|>
do you actually know where your money is going <|endoftext|>
kudos to the bbc for selflabelling its state affiliation <|endoftext|>
technically twitter should have that label <|endoftext|>
would be great if someone could compile a game contest of who said the craziest stuff between chan <|endoftext|>
are these real this video implies people physically show up to work <|endoftext|>
companies in general are missing the incredible opportunity that twitter provides to reach customers just tweet <|endoftext|>
the truth is finally coming out <|endoftext|>
population collapse is an existential problem for humanity not overpopulation <|endoftext|>
twitter verified tweets are more likely to be recommended to others as they are less likely to be bots or troll farms <|endoftext|>
government data has far more latency error than people think which is why its so frequently restat <|endoftext|>
is it even possible to parody their tweets im just literally wondering right now if its even possible <|endoftext|>
looking at the comments this social network might be trending positively towards positivity we will try to make that more the case <|endoftext|>
the recommendation algorithm will get much better and it will be open source <|endoftext|>
master the future doesnt sound ominous at all how is wefdavos even a thing are they tryin <|endoftext|>
trashing accounts that you hate will cause our algorithm to show you more of those accounts as it is keying off of <|endoftext|>
should twitter keep it active <|endoftext|>
this is a rare case where i agree with jacobin increasing quality of life for the aged is important but <|endoftext|>
to be clear im not someone who thinks lots of government agencies should be abolished maybe a few but we shoul <|endoftext|>
why did american media go from questioning the state and speaking truth to power to doing their bidding <|endoftext|>
will be interesting to see how the biden administration reacts to this they may try to weaponize federal agencies against twitter <|endoftext|>
the world economic forum should control the world <|endoftext|>
wef is increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and dont want <|endoftext|>
media want to control what you know which is why citizen journalism is essential <|endoftext|>
an update to the for you algorithm included too many tweets from people users didnt follow that change has been reverted <|endoftext|>
maybe because its online social how is it possible that copycat propaganda is pub <|endoftext|>
citizen journalism is vital to the future of civilization <|endoftext|>
are you still finding engagement to be low <|endoftext|>
the kind words are appreciated <|endoftext|>
one of the bot defenses we implemented was flagging any account responding to t <|endoftext|>
good question to ask him <|endoftext|>
it is very difficult to stop bots trolls while not affecting real users wont be perfe <|endoftext|>
twitter is arguably already the least wrong source of truth on the internet but we obviously still have a long way <|endoftext|>
coming soon are notifications if youve replied liked or retweeted something subsequently corrected by community <|endoftext|>
the peerenforced sameness of thought in most of the media is troubling <|endoftext|>
no i am wrong too often <|endoftext|>
trimming some government expenditures would be wise <|endoftext|>
peak oil demand probably happens within the next years <|endoftext|>
true there will be a long tail of usage but it will peak long before then <|endoftext|>
seriously it is super important to keep ace players in the united states forcing them to work for other countries is so crazy <|endoftext|>
fed rate increases make cars more expensive for consumers increas <|endoftext|>
your critique is spot on <|endoftext|>
hope you recover soon medical technology could be a lot better <|endoftext|>

great work by tesla team <|endoftext|>
i had major side effects from my second booster shot felt like i was dying for several days hopef <|endoftext|>

interesting entertaining content from around the world is worth seeing <|endoftext|>
two of the worst possible curses you will live forever you can have anything you want <|endoftext|>
back then george washington was the old guy at age <|endoftext|>
japan has higher total userminutes than the usa so japan is actually <|endoftext|>
im reviewing it next week for possible release <|endoftext|>
tweets will be translated before being recommended <|endoftext|>
there are epic tweets in other countries every day japan especially <|endoftext|>
next twitter update will remember whether you were on for you ie recommended following or list you made stop s <|endoftext|>
more than triple that when you add social security medicare govt pension obligations <|endoftext|>
or spending too much time on social media <|endoftext|>
in coming months twitter will translate recommend amazing tweets from people in other countries cultures <|endoftext|>
exactly if companies post interesting or entertaining content they will gain an audience rapidly <|endoftext|>
i am super pro ukraine but relentless escalation is very risky for ukraine and the world <|endoftext|>
of people still have no idea how profound this is <|endoftext|>
macron is doing the difficult but right thing the retirement age of was set when lifespans wer <|endoftext|>
it is actually not true employee headcount is almost double that <|endoftext|>

major twitter improvement we just released is that you can now bookmark tweets from tweet details page importantl <|endoftext|>
twitter app update now available on app store <|endoftext|>
onboarding should have fewer steps not more but creating pinned lists should automatically be off <|endoftext|>
use pinned lists to improve your twitter experience tap lists on your profile page create list of accounts <|endoftext|>
teslas are the safest cars on the road but most people dont know that <|endoftext|>
bolitho also fought in the battle of the somme he was buried alive in a pile of bodies with a broken neck <|endoftext|>
this is bizarre looking into it <|endoftext|>
ok maybe a little pontificating <|endoftext|>
app update has been approved by apple should go out in next day or so <|endoftext|>
the pendulum has swung a bit too far <|endoftext|>
even if you tax every billionaire in america at it barely makes a dent in the national debt <|endoftext|>
if bots are removed from the system their likes will be removed too are you seeing likes <|endoftext|>
i dont like the taste or effects of most alcohol but there is something quite beautiful about red wine in a fine glass <|endoftext|>
it can summarized with one emoji <|endoftext|>
major respect for the makers <|endoftext|>
no change in copper production is required for the transition to sustainable energy <|endoftext|>
another case of parody reality being indistinguishable <|endoftext|>
wow lot has happened in years <|endoftext|>
one of my favorite features <|endoftext|>
where have they not found classified documents that might be a shorter list <|endoftext|>
we are going to great lengths to avoid the wikipedia left wing editorial control pr <|endoftext|>
yeah were thinking hard about this <|endoftext|>
absolutely freedom means freedom to die when you are sure that you want to <|endoftext|>
maybe theres a way to do this by placing an ad below tweet details <|endoftext|>
also there will be a higher priced subscription that allows zero ads <|endoftext|>
ads are too frequent on twitter and too big taking steps to address both in coming weeks <|endoftext|>
that is a little delayed as a key researcher can only travel to twitter in early feb <|endoftext|>
twitter is the source of truth <|endoftext|>
was required to visit tesla giga berlin not my choice <|endoftext|>
the note is incorrect there are active working employees at twitter there are still hundr <|endoftext|>
i had og c before vaccines came out and it was basically a mild cold the <|endoftext|>
and my cousin who is young in peak health had a serious case of myocarditis had to go to the hospital <|endoftext|>
that turned out to be um inaccurate <|endoftext|>
population collapse is a major risk to the future of civilization <|endoftext|>
far too much power is concentrated in the hands of shareholder services companie <|endoftext|>
and then was at twitter hq past midnight very long day <|endoftext|>
congrats tesla california factory team on alltime record production <|endoftext|>

nobody is in favor of the russian invasion but how does this end with the least amount of bloodshed <|endoftext|>
kudos to aclu for this nonpartisan support of free speech <|endoftext|>
only a matter of time <|endoftext|>
de facto attack on first amendment <|endoftext|>

i work all day then go home play work simulator <|endoftext|>
they should keep them operating <|endoftext|>
a quarter of all taxes just to pay the interest on the debt <|endoftext|>
thats way more monkeys than the movie <|endoftext|>
you should see what i get <|endoftext|>
nothing conveys gravitas better than being called mr tweet <|endoftext|>
so then why do call yourself the associated press <|endoftext|>
well are you going to retract your fake stories or simply hope that people forget about them <|endoftext|>
do you care about the truth or what is left or right what matters more to you <|endoftext|>
she is blinded by hatred <|endoftext|>
haha this doofus actually believes what the media writes about me <|endoftext|>
italy many other nations are dying <|endoftext|>

they should lets see which ones actually come clean <|endoftext|>
shame on for misleading the public <|endoftext|>
i could really use those features <|endoftext|>
am hearing this from many people will investigate <|endoftext|>
im sure everything will be fine <|endoftext|>
its only a matter of time <|endoftext|>
next app update will make for you or following choice persist agreed that recommende <|endoftext|>
and hes building a giant rocket to get back to his home planet <|endoftext|>
this is the tweet for which was condemned and which i deleted within hours of posting <|endoftext|>
how exactly is it breaking down youre literally using it right now and why are you objectin <|endoftext|>
thats incorrect youre only half the product as you get half the ads we will offer a no ads subscription soon <|endoftext|>
this is the biggest journalism scam in a very long time <|endoftext|>
they did a great job <|endoftext|>
congrats on a beautiful tesla solar roof installation <|endoftext|>
youre welcome note apparent engagement on twitter will seem lower as bots would likefollowre <|endoftext|>
another major improvement in timeline refresh speed just released now x faster than a few months ago <|endoftext|>
somehow the sign sorta works <|endoftext|>
the lesson of history is that countries do not heed the lesson of history <|endoftext|>
disingenuous response from hamilton regarding their fake claims of russian interference <|endoftext|>
the brothers were very grim indeed <|endoftext|>
makes my eyes hurt to look at it <|endoftext|>
why margin loans should be avoided in turbulent macroeconomic conditions <|endoftext|>
its weird when they use the exact same words almost simultaneously <|endoftext|>
turns out that hell is just twitter lol <|endoftext|>
most ironic thing ive read in a while how much wood could a woodcock <|endoftext|>
here we are in the afterlife <|endoftext|>
just leaving the engine bay of starship <|endoftext|>
i dont know this person at all but explicit threats of violence obviously violate twitter tos <|endoftext|>
less than chuck norris though <|endoftext|>
looks like tesla is doing ok <|endoftext|>
chuck norris could recover all the funds from ftx <|endoftext|>

i was just reviewing the production beta cybertruck it is incredible <|endoftext|>
youre welcome axed them yesterday to focus on enabling writers to add essays as attachments to tweets <|endoftext|>
business insider is not a real publication <|endoftext|>
no one is above the constitution <|endoftext|>
it expresses this view without a shred of doubt which is discordant with the scientific method <|endoftext|>
wow this is extremely concerning <|endoftext|>
spacex starlink has become the connectivity backbone of ukraine all the way up to the fr <|endoftext|>
damned if you do damned if you dont <|endoftext|>
another batch of starlinks in orbit these will mostly support high latitude connectivity <|endoftext|>
they are behind the times <|endoftext|>
hydro nuclear fission geothermal will also be significant parts of the solution <|endoftext|>
you are an expert in propaganda <|endoftext|>
wind solar combined with batteries will solve sustainable energy for earth <|endoftext|>
expendable upper stage may or may not fly but it is an option <|endoftext|>
once again parody reality are indistinguishable <|endoftext|>
the war is escalating quickly <|endoftext|>
over time we expect giga nevada to be almost entirely solarpowered <|endoftext|>
its already the biggest battery cell pack electric motor factory in americas <|endoftext|>
what the tesla giga nevada factory will look like when finished <|endoftext|>
good meeting with regarding eu dsa the goals of transparency accountability accuracy of informat <|endoftext|>
reply threads are the modern forum for debates <|endoftext|>
in turbulent economic times be wary of using margin loans to buy stock <|endoftext|>
humanity takes up very little of earths surface area you can fit the entire population of earth i <|endoftext|>
this helped identify some issues with the system should be addressed by next week <|endoftext|>
twitters legacy blue verified is unfortunately deeply corrupted so will sunset in a few months <|endoftext|>
to be eligible the account must be a subscriber to twitter blue verified <|endoftext|>
starting today twitter will share ad revenue with creators for ads that appear in their reply threads <|endoftext|>
i guess we could give all verified users access to the api for posts like this <|endoftext|>
sucks that i had to sell so much tesla stock to do so sigh <|endoftext|>
yeah still many small tweaks to make it better and the side mirrors are removable by owner but th <|endoftext|>
yuh that is par for the course <|endoftext|>
super appreciate support of major advertisers congrats to twitter team <|endoftext|>
yeah free api is being abused badly right now by bot scammers opinion manipulators ther <|endoftext|>
petty tech beefs are one of the reasons i like this site <|endoftext|>
thank goodness the wisdom of the people has prevailed i am deeply appreciative of the jurys unanimous finding o <|endoftext|>
truth is stranger than fiction <|endoftext|>
more to come on this front twitter needs to be where a creator is most highly r <|endoftext|>
documentaries are dangerous in this way that said mj clearly had major issues no documentary needed for that <|endoftext|>
responding to feedback twitter will enable a light writeonly api for bots <|endoftext|>
production will have red light bar <|endoftext|>
v has been tougher than expected as it is a significant rearchitecture of nns plus many more nn <|endoftext|>
very hard car to build as it is unlike any other but as stated publicly cybertruck production starts this year <|endoftext|>
if remaining tests go well we will attempt a starship launch next month <|endoftext|>
ordered how to scam book months ago but still not arrived starting to think it could be but no im sure its coming soon <|endoftext|>
a tragic loss of life <|endoftext|>
starlink is not approved by turkish government yet spacex can send as soon as approved <|endoftext|>
we think we fixed this bug today please lmk if youre still seeing it <|endoftext|>
attempt to launch in march success is far from certain but excitement is guaranteed <|endoftext|>
to be extra clear twitter is definitely not financially healthy yet but is trending to be so lot <|endoftext|>
we would love to just waiting for government approvals <|endoftext|>
just posted in italian for those in italy that may wish to have it for prima <|endoftext|>
im worried about me too <|endoftext|>
daily user count total user minutes are still strong but engagement on some accounts is weirdly low <|endoftext|>
thank you for supporting twitter <|endoftext|>
weve found corrected some smaller issues but there is something fundamental that we havent <|endoftext|>
last months were extremely tough as had to save twitter from bankruptcy while fulfilling essential tesla <|endoftext|>
my bro and i mostly ate at the palo alto jack in the box while building zip it was afforda <|endoftext|>
actual base level of maslows hierarchy is lack of wifi <|endoftext|>
guess people love home improvement <|endoftext|>
of course hed like it he created it <|endoftext|>
if thats satan we have nothing to worry about <|endoftext|>
the level of luck needed to win is insane <|endoftext|>
almost everywhere you go everyone is face to their phone <|endoftext|>
uh oh plot involves using fear of a pandemic to get the public to demand lockdowns then controlling <|endoftext|>
its not supposed to be real <|endoftext|>
and it would be illegal <|endoftext|>
the un is more likely to cause rather than prevent disinformation <|endoftext|>
i havent seen a scroll in ages but we use that word for computer screens <|endoftext|>
this is a major problem <|endoftext|>
hopefully humanity will reach mars in years <|endoftext|>
read this thread for more detail <|endoftext|>
that is the line they fed the media about me <|endoftext|>
they are a threat to our democracy <|endoftext|>
the worst offender in us government censorship media manipulation is an obscure agency called gec <|endoftext|>
maybe thats whats meant the beyond part <|endoftext|>
most are oblivious to the danger <|endoftext|>
please correct the above numbers <|endoftext|>
voxel size of the simulation <|endoftext|>
arguably the practical limit of pi is the number of digits required to measure radius of the unive <|endoftext|>
master plan the path to a fully sustainable energy future for earth will be presented on march the future i <|endoftext|>
wow stengel is explicitly saying that gec is deceiving the american public thats what propagan <|endoftext|>
going forward twitter will be broadly accepting of different values rather than trying to impose its own specific values on the world <|endoftext|>
this is being fixed policy against showing blood in profile pic is being amend <|endoftext|>
if they really arrested a kid for that its silly hopefully not <|endoftext|>
twitter has been informed by the turkish government that access will be reenabled shortly <|endoftext|>
we are reaching out to understand more <|endoftext|>
not a completely unblemished record <|endoftext|>
fsd is close to limited release just drove it through sf la yesterday probably is able to go wide <|endoftext|>
cracks me up every time <|endoftext|>
team turned off engine just before start stopped itself so engines fired overall but still enough engin <|endoftext|>
attempting starship engine static fire <|endoftext|>
too many journalists want to shape your opinion rather than inform you <|endoftext|>
its legit day at this point <|endoftext|>
that engine performed an incredible number of transformations to match mach number <|endoftext|>
recommendation algorithm should be fixed tomorrow <|endoftext|>
the woke stasi felt the heat today <|endoftext|>
multiple internal external issues simultaneously today should be fully back on track later tonight <|endoftext|>
since he placed many of them there himself he would indeed not be surprised lmao <|endoftext|>
my pet theory is that too much adderall is making people grumpy <|endoftext|>
legacy blue checks will be removed soon those are the ones that are truly corrupt <|endoftext|>
and making a day in the life videos <|endoftext|>

top change requests and features <|endoftext|>
it will change the look of the roads <|endoftext|>
spacex commercial terminals like other commercial products are meant for private use n <|endoftext|>
hopefully one day we will be the aliens visiting other worlds <|endoftext|>
starship orbital launch attempt soon <|endoftext|>
absolutely twitter is also a competitor to legacy media for news so they are fundamentally conflicted <|endoftext|>
youre smart enough not to swallow media other propaganda bs starlink is the communication bac <|endoftext|>
exactly this will greatly increase public awareness that a tesla can drive itself supervised for now <|endoftext|>
more work team completed over night removed height penalty affecting tweets with picsvideo increased of re <|endoftext|>
maybe thats what bacteria think as they encounter your water filter <|endoftext|>
dont worry just some of my friends of mine stopping by <|endoftext|>

v single stack goes to limited beta this week probably before wide release in north ame <|endoftext|>
the giant block lists are problematic they mess up the recommendation system create a ddos vector <|endoftext|>
we will transition to using only paid blue verified for signals as otherwise too vulnerable to bottroll manipulation <|endoftext|>
anecdotally it wasnt as loud as expected <|endoftext|>
yes advertising also needs to be semantic keywordbased so its contextually relevant amazingly ads sh <|endoftext|>
oversized font undersized paragraph spacing will be fixed this week <|endoftext|>

halftime show super bowl lvii <|endoftext|>

damn thats impressive bus driving <|endoftext|>
haha exactly i dont even follow them and still i see their articles <|endoftext|>
just like other media lol <|endoftext|>
i get all my opinions from twitter <|endoftext|>
low birth rates lead to ghost cities and eventually ghost civilizations <|endoftext|>
turns out we just needed to blow on the cartridge <|endoftext|>
theres no substitute for good judgment <|endoftext|>
this year should average around tons of useful mass to orbit per quarter <|endoftext|>
my english grandmother taught me that it is disrespectful to use pronouns and that one should always use the persons name <|endoftext|>
rip cancel culture you wont be missed <|endoftext|>
please stay tuned while we make adjustments to the uh algorithm <|endoftext|>

i am perfect because i do not make any mistakes the mistakes are not mine they are theirs they are the externa <|endoftext|>
tesla vision ai could really crush these google not a bot tests lol <|endoftext|>
lego is my favorite example of how extreme precision does not need to be expensive it is mostly about caring <|endoftext|>
what could possibly go wrong <|endoftext|>
if the most ironic outcome is the most likely clippy is the face of doom <|endoftext|>
thank you tesla is happy to support other evs via our supercharger network <|endoftext|>
are you singularity dont be lonely find a date <|endoftext|>
might need a bit more polish <|endoftext|>
this tiny candle of consciousness we have on earth might be all there is <|endoftext|>
seemed like the right venue <|endoftext|>
he is perfect for the job <|endoftext|>
so much better than that other guy <|endoftext|>
the new ceo of twitter is amazing <|endoftext|>
allowing users to make some of their lists optionally public would be great <|endoftext|>
it is still far too difficult to find out that lists exist and then create them ui modifications <|endoftext|>
yes worth noting that accounts you follow on lists are private <|endoftext|>
twitter pinned lists are great <|endoftext|>
a lot has happened in ten years <|endoftext|>
who controls the future controls the present <|endoftext|>
haha exactly also im independentmoderate not conservative or liberal ive only voted republica <|endoftext|>
definitely the word recall for an overtheair software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong <|endoftext|>
this is gonna be great <|endoftext|>
well i would hope that most san franciscans agree with this principle <|endoftext|>
yeah it would be crazy to make an ai like that irl <|endoftext|>
you are not alone when i ask people if they use twitter almost all have for many years when i as <|endoftext|>
never seen anything so messed up wish it wasnt but were making good progress albeit with m <|endoftext|>
my apologies you must be a genius which is why twitter has the worst ad relevance on earth almost nobody <|endoftext|>
this is my finest work please add to gravestone along with invented car fart <|endoftext|>
the algorithm needs will get major upgrades we will still publish it later this month but please expe <|endoftext|>
thats been true for a long time is a function of an accounts popularity bieber was top recommendat <|endoftext|>
i was made the tom of twitter by twitter <|endoftext|>
seriously and i dont even follow them <|endoftext|>
note if many people who you follow or like also follow me it is highly probable that the algorithm will recommend <|endoftext|>
your article is false and obviously so do you really do no research at all i mean like reading a <|endoftext|>
synchronization lag between our portland and atlanta data centers should be fixed now <|endoftext|>
this is a major crisis <|endoftext|>
what we need is truthgpt <|endoftext|>
that was an accurate ratio of those who actually wrote code to those who did not <|endoftext|>
some of twitters prior board members had never written a single tweet <|endoftext|>
sorry for showing you so many irrelevant annoying ads on twitter were taking the obvious corrective action <|endoftext|>
true but on the plus side their constant reporting about me on twitter has driven usage to record levels <|endoftext|>
the source of the bogus platformer article is a disgruntled employee who had been on <|endoftext|>
for example despite having m fewer followers back then i have yet to come anywhere close to this gem <|endoftext|>
several major media sources incorrectly reported that my tweets were boosted above normal levels earlier this week <|endoftext|>
openai was created as an open source which is why i named it open ai nonprofit company to serve as <|endoftext|>
whoa ancient times when was that <|endoftext|>
chatgpt to the mainstream media <|endoftext|>
agreed it is clearly not safe yet <|endoftext|>
the amount of solar energy received by earth could power a civilization over times larger than ours <|endoftext|>
absolutely the amount of solar energy reaching earth could easily power a civilization x times our size <|endoftext|>
use of free authentication apps for fa will remain free and are much more secure than sms <|endoftext|>

my favorite video of starship so far great shot when the flame points right at the camera <|endoftext|>
we are part rom part ram <|endoftext|>
another good reason to phase it out <|endoftext|>
twitter is getting scammed by phone companies for myear of fake fa sms messages <|endoftext|>
fate loves irony but hates hypocrisy <|endoftext|>
commercial airlines in the us are much safer per mile traveled than trains or cars <|endoftext|>
tragic i hope sf comes back from this emptiness it is such a beautiful city with so many amazing people <|endoftext|>
id like to thank the advertising community that has stuck with us as we improve our ad products <|endoftext|>
same irrelevantannoying ads work for neither the user nor the advertiser <|endoftext|>
a big part of the problem is that journalists used to choose their career to pursue truth but in r <|endoftext|>
we started improving relevance in december but still a very long way to go <|endoftext|>
or at least it is indistinguishable from such either way <|endoftext|>
imagine this is your now i will explain with my hands <|endoftext|>
your strategic imperative is defending the united states <|endoftext|>
good use of long tweet next update will allow much longer tweets with basic formatting so you can post <|endoftext|>
i mean nobody is that smart <|endoftext|>
especially if they say theyre an expert at both dead giveaway <|endoftext|>
all things in moderation especially content moderation <|endoftext|>
